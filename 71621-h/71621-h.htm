<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Above</span> Assouan, the terminus of tourists is the Nubian
Desert, a yellow arm of the Sahara, thrust between Central
Africa and Egypt. When this desert is crossed, you come
to the ancient Ethiopia, which consists of lowlands watered
by the Nile, while a little to the left is Abyssinia, the
Switzerland of Africa. The White Nile, which comes from
the Equator, is hereabouts joined by the Blue Nile, or
Black Nile, from the Abyssinian Wells; and near their
confluence is the town, Khartoom. In the glorious days of
the Pharaohs Ethiopia was colonised by Egypt, and there
was a famous city, Meroe by name, possessing pyramids
and temples. In the days of Egyptian decline Ethiopia
became independent, conquered the mother country for a
time, and was never entered by the armies of the Persians.
The Ptolemies who afterwards reigned at Alexandria did
conquer Ethiopia, even to its Highlands, carrying their
arms, as they boasted, where the Pharaohs themselves had
never been; but the Romans did not occupy the country;
they followed the advice of Augustus,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the Nubian
Desert was made their frontier.</p>

<p>In the same manner the Arabs under the caliphs did not
attempt the conquest of Ethiopia, and it was perhaps owing to
Buonaparte that Turkish Egypt advanced so far to the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
The French expedition has always been stigmatised as a
fruitless crime. But by the French the power of the Mamelukes
was broken; by the French was displayed on Egyptian
soil the superior genius of Europe, and thence may be
derived a movement similar to that which in the days of
the Pharaohs was produced by the Phil-Hellenes, or kings
who were “lovers of the Greeks.” Mehemet Ali organised
an army in the European manner, and crossing the Nubian
Desert, conquered the lowlands of Ethiopia or Soudan. At
the same time he commenced the civilisation of Cairo.
These two great projects, culture in the capital, and conquest
in Soudan, have been carried out of late years with
marvellous intelligence and energy by the reigning Khedive.
To understand what has been accomplished, let us compare
the Egypt and Ethiopia of the present with the past.</p>

<p>In the past, a European traveller who visited Egypt
incurred contumely and considerable risk. He was not
allowed to ride on a horse; he was called “dog” by the
pious who passed him in the streets, and pelted by the
playful gamin; the dogs barked at him; the women turned
their eyes away as if they had seen an unclean thing. But
now Cairo, like Rome and Florence, lives upon tourists, who,
if they are not beloved, are welcome; the city is lighted by
gas: it has public gardens in which a native military band
performs every afternoon; an excellent theatre, for which
Verdi composed Aïda; new houses in the Parisian style are
springing up by streets, and are let out at high rents as soon
as they are finished. No gentleman wears a turban; and few
any longer affect to despise the blessings of a good education.</p>

<p>Let us now pass on to the south. In the olden time the
Nubian Desert was infested by roving bandit-tribes. Since
the days of Mehemet Ali they have earned an honest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
livelihood by letting out their camels: and soon they will
become navvies, railway porters, &amp;c. Already there is
telegraphic communication between Cairo and Khartoom,
and a railway is about to be commenced. As for the
Soudan, it was formerly divided among a number of barbarous
chiefs almost incessantly at war. It is now conquered
and at peace, and trade is seldom disturbed. Civilised
opinion, all-powerful at Cairo, penetrates into the remotest
recesses of this new African empire; the traffic in slaves is
abolished, and those who perpetrated their crimes in the
dark depths of the continent have lately been reached by
the arm of the law.</p>

<p>It is my purpose in making these remarks to show what
facilities for geographical research are afforded by the power
and good will of Egypt. In former times the explorer
began at the Nubian Desert or the Red Sea; he might be
plundered of all that he possessed before he entered negro
Africa at all. Supposing he arrived safely in Sennaar, he
was at once exposed to those vexatious extortions and
delays which so frequently robbed him of his money and his
health before he had opened new ground. As it is, a
firmam from the Viceroy obtains him men and boats from
the governor of Khartoom, and therefore his point of
departure is shifted many degrees to the south. He is now
able to penetrate into the heart of Africa before he encounters
an independent chief. The area of the firmam is
immense, but beyond that area the dangers and difficulties
of travel are perhaps increased by the aggressive policy of
Egypt. The princes of Darfoor and Waday have a constant
dread of annexation, and a European traveller, if he entered
those countries, would find it difficult to obtain his congé.
The west forest region which lies south of Darfoor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
Waday, and also along the main stream of the Nile, has
always been a slave-hunting ground; annual raids are made
from Darfoor and Waday, the hunters taking out licences
from their kings,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the Egyptian company of bandits,
whom Sir Samuel Baker recently dispersed, hunted the
land south of Grondokoro. These wars unsettled the country
and rendered it difficult for travel. The slave-hunters
intrigued against the European, fearing that he would
expose them to the government at Cairo; and the slave-hunted
had learnt to regard all white men as their foes
and oppressors. Thus it has happened that out of a host
of men who have attempted to penetrate Africa from north
to south only two have achieved success. The first and
foremost of these is Sir Samuel Baker; the second is Dr.
G. A. Schweinfurth, the author of this work.</p>

<p>He was born at Riga in December 1836, and was the
son of a merchant. He studied at Heidelberg and Berlin,
where he took his degree as Doctor of Philosophy, and devoted
himself from his boyhood to the science of botany. At his
first school one of the masters was a son of a missionary in
South Africa; he used often to describe the wonders of that
country, and perhaps it was in this manner that his mind
was turned towards that country which afterwards created
his career. But the proximate cause was a collection of
plants placed in his hands to arrange and describe. In 1860,
the young Freiherr von Barnim, accompanied by Dr.
Hartmann, had made a journey in the region of the Nile,
where he had fallen a victim to the climate. His collections
were brought home, and as Schweinfurth day after day
studied these dry corpses, a yearning came upon him to go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
the land where he might behold them in all their bloom and
their beauty, and where he might discover new species—&#8203;those
<em>golden joys</em> for the explorer. In 1863, he left Berlin
for Egypt, and having botanised in the Delta of the Nile,
travelled along the shores of the Red Sea, skirted the
Highlands of Abyssinia, passed on to Khartoom, and finally,
his purse being empty, returned to Europe, after an absence
of two years and a half, with a splendid collection of plants.
But soon he languished for Africa again, and submitted to
the Royal Academy of Science a plan for the botanical
exploration of the equatorial districts lying west of the Nile.
His proposals were at once accepted; he received a grant of
money from the Humboldt Institution, and, in 1868, he
landed in Egypt. During three years he was absent in the
<em>heart of Africa</em>, and, even before he had returned, his name had
already become famous in Europe and America. Travelling,
not in the footsteps of Baker, but in a westerly direction, he
reached the neighbourhood of Baker’s lake, passing through
the country of the Niam-Niam, and visiting the unknown
kingdom of Monbuttoo. As an explorer, he stands in the
highest rank, and merits to be classed with Mungo Park,
Denham and Clapperton, Livingstone, Burton, Speke and
Grant, Barth and Rohlfs. He can also claim two qualifications
which no African traveller has hitherto possessed. He
is a scientific botanist, and also an accomplished draughtsman.
Park had some knowledge of botany, and Grant
made an excellent collection, but both must be regarded
as merely amateurs. In other works of African travel the
explorer has given rude sketches to some professional artist,
and thus the picture has been made; but Schweinfurth’s
sketches were finished works of art. In a geographical sense,
this work is of importance as a contribution to the problem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
of the Nile; and ethnologically it sets at rest a point which
has long been under dispute, viz., the existence of a dwarf
race in Central Africa. These Pygmies are mentioned by the
classical writers; much has been said about them by modern
travellers on the Nile; Krapf saw one on the Eastern
Coast; the old voyagers allude to their existence in the
kingdom of the Congo, and Du Chaillu met them in
Ashango Land. Yet still much mystery remained which,
thanks to Schweinfurth, is now at an end. That such a race
exists is now placed beyond a doubt; and it is probable that
these dwarfs are no other than the Bushmen of South
Africa, who are not confined, as was formerly supposed, to
that corner of the continent, but also inhabit various remote
recesses of Africa, and were probably the original natives of
the country.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span>, in the summer of 1868, I prepared for the great
journey, of which the following pages contain the description,
I was already no novice on African soil. In 1863 I had
served an apprenticeship in the art of travelling in the sunny
fields of Egypt and Nubia. For months together, in my own
boat, I had navigated the Red Sea; and it was while I was
exploring the untraversed mountains by its coasts that I
seriously conceived my larger project. My curiosity was
particularly attracted towards the district of the independent
Bishareen. I had then repeatedly crossed the country between
the Nile and the sea, and while sojourning on the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
terraces of the Abyssinian highlands, I had learnt to appreciate
the full enchantment of the wonders of nature in Africa.</p>

<p>In 1866, passing through Khartoom and Berber, I found
my way back again to Egypt.</p>

<p>Once entertained, the project of the botanical investigation
of these lands resolved itself more and more into the
problem of my life. The splendid herbarium, too, which I
had carried home as the reward of my labours, obtained
though it was at the cost of repeated attacks of fever, contributed
to intensify my desire. Altogether the result of my
first attempt was an encouragement and happy omen for my
success in a second. My experience hitherto was likewise
advantageous to me so far as this,—&#8203;it had afforded opportunity
of cultivating the faculty so necessary to every explorer
of unknown districts, of correctly generalising from
details. Observations and impressions require to be surveyed
from a comprehensive point of view, in order that the characteristic
features of a country may be represented in their true
proportions.</p>

<p>Besides this general information which I had practically
gained and which I could no more have learnt from books
than I could have learnt the foreign habits and modes of
thought, I had also acquired that fluency in the Arab
vernacular which is indispensable to every traveller, and
which, moreover, appears to suffice for the whole of the
immense district which is commanded by the Nile and its
host of tributaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOTANICAL ARDOUR.</div>

<p>Herbarium, topography, and language all seemed to
favour me; the chief drawback was the state of my health.
I suffered from a disorganised condition of the spleen, which
gave me some uneasiness and misgiving; yet, after all, it
appeared to be just the key that had unlocked the secret of
the unexampled good fortune of my journey. The numerous
attacks of fever had probably reduced it to such a state of
inactivity, that it ceased to be affected by any miasma; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
perhaps it had assumed the function of a condensator, so as
to render the miasma innocuous. Anyhow, it seemed to
perform services which I could not do otherwise than gratefully
accept as a timely gift of Providence. As a farewell
on my landing in Alexandria, I experienced one slight
twinge from my malady, and then it was quiet; it did not
again re-appear even in the noxious swamps of the Upper
Nile, which had been disastrous to so many of my predecessors.
No recurrence of my disorder interrupted my
activity or clouded my enjoyment, but fever-free I remained,
an exception among a hundred travellers.</p>

<p>The time which elapsed between the completion of my
first, and the commencement of my second journey, was
occupied in studies which were directed to the scientific
classification and analysis of what had been so abundantly
secured.</p>

<p>Whoever knows the blameless avarice of a plant-hunter
will understand how these studies could only arouse in me a
craving after fresh booty. I could not forget that the
greater part of the Nile territory, with the mysterious flora
of its most southern affluents, still remained a fresh field for
botanical investigations; and no wonder that it presented
itself as an object irresistibly attractive to my desires. But
one who has himself, on the virgin soil of knowledge in unopened
lands, been captivated by the charm of gathering
fresh varieties, and has surrendered himself to the unreserved
enjoyment of Nature’s freedom, will be prompted to yet
keener eagerness; such an one cannot be daunted by any
privation he has undergone, nor deterred by any alarm for
his health: he recalls as a vision of Paradise the land he has
learnt to love; he exaggerates the insalubrity of a northern
climate; he bewails the wretched formality of our civilised
life, and so, back to the distant solitudes flies his recollection
like a dove to the wilderness.</p>

<p>Of this kind were my impressions as these two years passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
away. I was prohibited from any immediate prosecution of
my hope by the inadequacy of my pecuniary means. A welcome
opportunity, however, soon presented itself, and enabled
me to resume my investigation of the district of the Nile.</p>

<p>After the death of Alexander von Humboldt, there had
been founded in Berlin, as a monument of gratitude and
recognition of his services, the “Humboldt Institution of
Natural Philosophy and Travels.” The object of this was,
without regard to nationality or creed, to assist talent in
every direction in which Humboldt had displayed his
scientific energies; and it was especially directed that the
funds should be applied to promote travels in the most-remote
districts. The Institute contemplated a supply of
means for the prosecution of those philosophical studies to
which Humboldt dedicated himself with such unceasing
ardour. The Royal Academy of Science of Berlin was
vested alike with the power of deciding on the undertakings
and of selecting suitable agents to carry out their designs.</p>

<p>To that eminent scientific corporation I ventured to submit
a scheme for the botanical investigation of those equatorial
districts which are traversed by the western affluents of the
Upper Nile. My proposal met with a ready sanction, and
I was rejoiced to receive a grant of the disposable funds of
the Institution, which had been accumulating for the space
of five years.</p>

<p>Thus it happened, that in July 1868 I was once more upon
the soil of Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT COUNTENANCE.</div>

<p>During my first stay at Khartoom, which is the centre of
government of the Egyptian Soudan, I had collected a
variety of information about the ivory expeditions undertaken
by the merchants of the place to the country about the
sources of the Nile; I had likewise made certain alliances
with the natives, and by these means I hoped to project a
plan for a scientific progress over the district on a firm basis.
There was no doubt that in the heathen negro districts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the Upper Nile, the Egyptian Government exercised little
influence and no authority. Under its direction, the Khartoom
merchants had indeed done something—&#8203;for sixteen
years they had traversed the land in well-nigh every direction,
and they had established stations for themselves in the
negro borders; but they had not made good any hold upon
the territory in general. Nevertheless, I had no alternative
than to conclude that without the countenance of the Government,
and without the co-operation and support of the merchants,
there was no reasonable expectation that the objects
of a scientific traveller could be forwarded.</p>

<p>I was quite aware that various travellers had already
attempted, at a large sacrifice of money, to arrange independent
expeditions, and to engage an adequate number of
armed men on their own responsibility; but no sooner
had they reached the more remote regions, where the few
channels of the river were all in the hands of the merchants,
than they necessarily became dependent on the merchants
for their supplies. There was, besides, no other quarter on
which to rely for obtaining porters, who are indispensable in
a country where all known beasts of burden are accustomed
in a short time to succumb to the climate.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, therefore, I soon came to the determination
of being taken in the train of the merchants of Khartoom,
trusting that the countries opened by them would
offer sufficient scope for all my energies. It was probable
that the ivory traders would never, of their own accord, want
to thwart me; yet I would not rely entirely on this, as I
knew that they were themselves subjects of the Viceroy. As
matter of fact, probably, they were entire masters of the
situation in the negro countries, and really irresponsible;
but still their interests made them apparently subservient to
an absolute government, and this was the handle that I
desired to use accordingly. By diplomatic interest, I had
secured the ostensible recognition of the Viceregal Government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
but from my own experience, I was fully convinced that
mere letters of recommendation to the local authorities, as
long as their contents are limited to ordinary formal phrases,
are of very questionable advantage. I might refer particularly
to Sir Samuel Baker’s misadventure as affording an
illustration of the insufficiency of such credentials. I
considered myself fortunate, therefore, in obtaining from the
Prime Minister of the Viceroy (although he was himself not
in residence) special orders, which I knew were indispensable,
to the Governor-General of Khartoom. The Governor-General
was to superintend any contract which I might
make with the merchants to secure that my journey through
the district of the Gazelle River should be unhindered, and
to ensure the due fulfilment of whatever obligations might
be undertaken.</p>

<p>Thus the course appeared to be smooth, by which I might
hope to reach the centre of the mysterious continent; but I
was still far from my object, still far from the point which I
could consider as the true starting-point of my real journey.
Between Alexandria and Khartoom was a route familiar
enough, but even Khartoom could hardly be deemed the
beginning. In order to reach the cannibal and the pigmy
there faced me, as perchance there does the reader, many a
trial of patience. What I did in Alexandria and Cairo can
afford little or no interest; I was there fully occupied in preparations
and purchases for my equipment, at times feeling
much depressed. Before me lay the uncertain future, and
the perils, which I could not conceal from myself, of this
inhospitable region; and behind me was Europe, in which
to dwell was insupportable, without seeing my cherished
designs accomplished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT SUEZ.</div>

<p>In Suez the dejection of despondency yielded to feelings
of a more lively nature, partly from vexation, partly from
amusement. The custom-house afforded me vexation, whilst
the Governor’s divan was an unfailing source of amusement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
I arrived in Suez on the 16th of August, proposing to
continue my journey to Djidda by the next steamer. Much
gratified by the intelligence that a steamer belonging to the
Sulphur Company would start in four days, I was proceeding
to embark at once, when I was stopped by the custom-house
authorities, who desired a strict investigation of the luggage,
and insisted upon payment of the tariff duties for every
article of my huge accumulation of baggage. Perhaps
everything might have been arranged, but when my additional
waggon appeared, although I explained that it had
been furnished me by the Government, and notwithstanding
that I was the bearer of letters directed to the Egyptian
revenue officers, the director required an extra special order,
and referred me to the Governor, who telegraphed back to
Alexandria. In the meantime, for the next two days, I was
compelled to take turns with my factotum, the Nubian
servant, to sit in the sun on my baggage in order to protect
my boxes which contained my money bags full of Maria
Theresa dollars. As a refuge for the night I betook myself
to a hotel, not much larger than a hut, in which I had already
some years previously found the accommodation just suited
to give me a foretaste of the privations of the desert.</p>

<p>My consternation may be imagined, when at last there
arrived from the capital an order that I must pay precisely
as any ordinary traveller. Hardly had I recovered my first
surprise, when accidentally one of the Governor’s clerks
called attention to some contradictions in the despatch.
Further inquiries were instituted, and the discovery was
made that an important word had been overlooked, and that
the tenor of the message was that I was “<em>not</em>” to pay.</p>

<p>Whilst this was going on, and I was kept in my suspense,
I stayed chiefly in the Governor’s divan. This officer, untroubled
at the revolutions which were taking place around
him, untouched by any development of the spirit of the age
so perceptible here, where three-quarters of the world join<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
hands, ruled his people in simplicity and in the fear of the
Lord. During the time which I passed sitting in his divan
awaiting the issue of events, I was a witness of several incidents
exhibiting this simplicity, and which struck me as
being somewhat ludicrous. First stepped in a swarthy-looking
fellow, with a knavish countenance, such as one meets
but seldom even in the streets of Alexandria. He wanted
to legitimatise himself in his character of a British subject,
or “<i lang="fr">protégé</i>” as he styled himself. To the Governor’s inquiry
where he came from, he said from Tarablus. “Tarablus!
then how can you be English?” said the Governor. “Why,
surely, because Tarablus is in the west,” replied the rogue.
It was objected that he was forging a lie, and that Tarablus
was not in the west, and thence there ensued a tedious
geographical discussion about Eastern and Western Tripoli.
The rascal went on to assert that his father was a native of
Malta, that after his death he had married, settled in Tripoli,
and had become a Mohammedan; and then he cunningly
added, “Allah be with you, and give you grace! I should
hope I could be an Englishman and yet be a good Mussulman.”
Quite satisfied, the Governor gave a contented look,
and let him pass. The order was given for the next applicant
to be heard. With hesitating steps there now approached
a little man, black and repulsive, bringing with
him a veiled girl to the front. It was a scene which suggested
the thought that he must be a slave-dealer, and it
reminded me of one of Horace Vernet’s famous pictures; but
the circumstances were different. He proceeded to unroll
mysteriously and display a splendid caftan of yellow silk.
He was, it seemed, a tailor of the suburbs, and the veiled
beauty was a slave-girl from Enarea, who had formerly been
sold for filthy lucre, and was now bartering her honesty under
the same inducement. The caftan was a gorgeous vestment
lined with imitation ermine, and not unlike the night-dress of
Ivan the Terrible, which is preserved in the Troitsky convent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
near Moscow. The girl had ordered the dress, and now
would not pay for it, and accordingly the tailor had brought
her with him to the Governor, and so enforced his demand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCENE IN THE DIVAN.</div>

<p>The next scene had a wonderful climax. It might almost
remind one of the tedious campaign ending with the sudden
collapse of Magdala. What the beginning of the contention
was, I cannot tell. The Governor had apparently been trying
to mediate between two Arnauts; but as the prolonged discourse
was carried on in Turkish, I did not understand it.
A quantity of apples were produced, and some of them laid
for an evidently conciliatory purpose beside the Governor.
All at once, however, some misunderstanding occurred, and
there arose a furious storm of apples: they were hurled in
every direction, the Bey himself being the originator of the
bombardment; and the scene closed as effectively as though
there had been a display of fireworks. For myself, I was
happily protected by my situation; but I could see all, and
am ready, if need be, to vouch for my representation in the
presence of the great Sultan himself. If any one is inclined
to suspect that such a sight is incompatible with the dignity
or indolence of Turks, I can only remind him that their
enlarged intercourse with temperaments less sluggish than
their own has broken down much of their composure; and
that now just as little patience can be expected from an
African Bey when he is irritated, as from an excited Bavarian
corporal. Although these details may appear to have no
direct connection with what concerns Central Africa, yet
they are significant as exhibiting how completely, for all purposes
of administration, every institution which is Turkish
or Mohammedan remains fixed on its ancient basis. Though
Suez were to become a second San Francisco, or however
much it might concentrate upon itself the traffic of the
world, scenes of judicial practice such as these would be
sure to recur until the last Pasha or Bey had taken farewell
of this mortal state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Since my first visit five years ago, in January 1864, the
population of Suez had increased threefold. The Abyssinian
campaign alone had been the means of almost doubling the
number of its inhabitants. A portion of the camp formed
for the marching troops, and an immense depôt for trusses
of hay, seeming well nigh like a large village in itself, were
now the sole relics of that successful enterprise.</p>

<p>The fresh-water canal, which had now been completed for
five years, had not effected any marked improvement upon
the melancholy environs of the town, where desolation still
reigned as ever; no gardens, no plantations, no verdure
relieved the eye, which sought its refreshment from the blue
sky and the azure sea. The hopeful expectations which
were entertained from that canal seem by no means to have
been realised. The deposit of any fertilising soil proceeded
very slowly, and hitherto had made no change in the condition
of vegetation at Suez, except just at the foot of the
Mokkatan mountains, where the boulder flats, unimpregnated
with salt, are traversed by a separate side branch of the
main canal. Large fields of vegetables are cultivated here,
and, without the aid of man, many varieties of desert plants
contribute to the verdure. The tourist who loves to inscribe
fresh acquisitions in his diary, may here without trouble find
the far-famed “rose of Jericho,” which he would seek in
vain around the suburbs of Cairo.</p>

<p>In order to reach Khartoom, I had chosen the sea-route
by Suakin, so as to avoid the heat and fatigue of a journey
through the great Nubian desert. This sea-route, by Suakin
and Berber, is quicker and altogether less expensive than
that by Assouan and Korosko; but it is not advisable for
merchants who are travelling with any quantity of goods,
on account of the heavy duties which are levied both at
starting from Suez and at landing at Suakin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE RED SEA.</div>

<p>To save trouble and time I thought it would be best to
proceed to Djidda, and there hire a sailing vessel to convey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
our party across to Suakin. To reach Djidda, I made choice
of a little French packet which was going thither in preference
to one of the Egyptian Azizieh steamers which ply
between Suez and Massowa. These larger vessels do indeed
touch both at Djidda and Suakin, but they are not suited
for general travellers. The name of our little steamer was
‘Prince Mohammed Tawfik,’ (the heir-apparent to the
throne of Egypt): it belonged to the “Compagnie Soufrière,”
and was commissioned to supply the sulphur mines of
Gimsah on the Egyptian coast with fresh water every
fourteen days. Although it was in no way adapted for
the conveyance of passengers, I was nevertheless quite
comfortable on board. It was a vessel of only 300 tons
burden, but by dividing the receptacle for conveying the
Nile water into seven separate compartments, a great
economy of space was effected, and a good hold reserved.
The fact of the captain being a Dane, was a still farther
recommendation.</p>

<p>It was a memorable morning, that 18th of August, on
which the sailing vessel was prepared to leave the roadstead.
Many a curious eye, in those early hours, was strained to
witness the sun, as its disk rose darkened by the shadow of
an eclipse. Above the flood of the Erythræan Sea appeared
a golden sickle, its crescent light bearing resemblance to the
moon. We were detained for yet two days in the roadstead;
but at last we weighed anchor, and the little craft soon
vanished from the midst of its more imposing neighbours,
the great mail ships and men-of-war, which gave such a
bright animation to the anchorage. A refreshing breeze
from the north-east carried us across the gulf. Ever deepening
violet shadows covered the shore, until the obscurity of
night had completely hidden Mount St. Catherine and the
Mount of Moses from our gaze. At dawn we were facing
the grim shore of the sulphur mountain. Here we were
greeted by the waving of the French tricolour, which, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
monotonous grey that mantled the whole land, afforded a
bright resting-place for the weary eye.</p>

<p>According to a treaty made with the Egyptian Government,
the Company are enabled to carry on their operations
over 160 miles of coast, south from Cape Seit, where the
Egyptian territory forms a promontory opposite the peninsula
of Sinai. The coast line is similar in outline to the adjacent
Gimsah, whilst, with the group of islands which lie off it, it
forms the entrance of the Gulf of Suez. We now passed down
the narrow channel which divides the group of islands from the
mainland, and there lay before us the bluff of Gimsah, a steep
mass of pure gypsum, white as chalk. This peak is about
200 feet above the level of the sea: it faces nearly south, its
aspect is bare, and like all the mountains contiguous to the
sea on these dreary and uninhabited coasts, it presents hardly
the faintest trace of vegetation. Since July, 1867, the mines
have been worked by a gang of labourers, of which twenty-six
were Europeans and 300 were brought from Upper
Egypt. For a time they were yielding a rich produce, which
afforded the best hopes for the future; but now, like so
much else in the country, have fallen into decay. The
mutual intrigues and corruption of the contractors have
yielded a fresh testimony on the one hand, to the continual
ill-luck of the Government, which seems fated never to be
able to improve the bounty of its natural resources; and on
the other, to the ruthless avarice of foreigners, which is ever
stopping the progress of the country. A tedious lawsuit
has laid bare a whole series of scandals, discreditable alike
to the directors and to the administrators of the Viceregal
Government. The state of affairs, even in 1868, was melancholy
enough. The Egyptian Government had contracted
to supply work in the mines at a stipulated daily rate of
payment. For the protection of the colony, as well as for
the maintenance of discipline among the workmen, a guard
of twenty-five soldiers was kept at Gimsah; this was rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
a superfluity, since the Egyptian workmen, once taken into
service, could not easily escape. They were hemmed in on
one side by wide deserts, which could not be traversed in a
day; and as for danger on the other from the Bedouins,
none could be apprehended. A report about the Bedouins,
which was current at Suez, could not fail to awaken my
interest. The passengers of a mail steamer, which had
lately foundered at the entrance of the Gulf, maintained that
they had seen on the opposite mainland a body of wild men
200 strong, looking out for booty and for plunder. Assuredly
by no exertions could the Bedouins collect such a force in
the course of a few hours. Poor sons of the desert, I knew
them better! An exhausted stomach, shrivelled up on their
long wanderings till it is like an empty water-bottle, is the
only voice in their naturally harmless character which could
excite to violence. Give them a couple of handfuls of durra-corn,
and you have made them the best of friends. Their
desire for plunder is limited to the robbing of turtles’ nests,
and the taking of eggs from the neighbouring islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SULPHUR WORKS AT GIMSAH.</div>

<p>Protected by numberless coral-reefs, the coasts of the
Red Sea everywhere afford to small vessels the most comfortable
harbours and anchorage. Here a short stone quay
sufficed as a mole for moorage, and close behind was a
grotto-like cistern in the rock, into which the water could
be pumped by means of pipes connected with the reservoirs
in the ship. On the narrow border of land between the foot
of the rock and the sea, were erected huts of planks for the
workmen, and barracks of stone for the officials of the Company.
Such was the little piece of land on which the colony,
composed of representatives of many a nation, prolonged its
deplorable existence. Bounded in front by the dreary
expanse of sea, which was rarely enlivened by a solitary sail,
shut in behind by the sun-scorched gypsum, they were thus
exposed to a double share of direct and reflected rays. The
atmosphere in which they toiled was burdened with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
stifling fumes of sulphur, and oppressed with the perpetual
odour of burning petroleum; not alone the welfare, but the
very existence of the colony, was dependent on the safe
return of the steamer which provided them with food and
drink. Whoever has lingered here can form some conception
of the endurances of the poor beasts in our zoological gardens,
which have been brought together from every zone, and
caged in hopeless imprisonment. So monotonously and void
of joy did the days of these wretched miners pass away; they
led a life more gloomy than monastic, which might almost
recall the first century of Christendom. Perhaps such a life
belongs to the air, for it may be remembered that the
renowned convents of St. Paul and St. Antony are distant
but a few miles to the north-west; they are remnants of the
oldest convents that are known, and to them, as often as a
patriarch is required, does Egypt, according to ancient rule,
ever turn to supply the vacancy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TROPICAL HEAT.</div>

<p>In reality the colony of Gimsah, when approached from
the sea, did present quite the appearance of a monastic
settlement in the heart of a desert. Caverns were hewn in
all directions, in order to work the veins of gypseous spar
containing the sulphur, and amongst them lay a row of
twelve hexagonal little houses, which were the kilns, built
after the Sicilian fashion, and which might at first be mistaken
for the cells of pious monks. To crown the denial and
privation of this existence, the Company, under the pretext
of maintaining discipline, order, and morality among the
miners, had peremptorily banished all women from the
sulphur coasts. This restriction was especially irritating to
the French, and as a refinement of cruelty was as intolerable
as those poisonous fumes of pitch and sulphur which were
here set free from the bowels of the earth. Nevertheless it
would seem to have answered well, for young and old, Arab
and European, went through their work with a diligence
such as is rarely to be observed in other tropical regions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Only when the sun’s heat after midday was most insupportable,
was there a cessation of labour. At 12 o’clock, when
the <i lang="fr">employé</i> of the Suez Canal, in his period of repose,
sauntered into the coffee-house to take an ice or to enjoy a
game at billiards, the untiring director began his daily circuit
of inspection; and seldom has a quotation seemed to me
more apt than that in which he said that the hour was come
in which he must surrender himself to the sulphurous and
torturing flames.</p>

<p>After staying twenty-four hours in the harbour at Gimsah,
the ‘Prince Mohammed Tawfik’ continued its voyage to
Djidda, where it arrived on the fourth day. At that season,
when no pilgrims were coming or going, we found the
harbour all but deserted; only one French and two Egyptian
men-of-war were in the security of the roadstead. I easily
obtained an open Arab boat, which I hoped, under favourable
gales, should convey me to Suakin.</p>

<p>On account of the prevalence of north-winds through the
greater part of the year, navigation in the Red Sea is nearly
always as easy in this direction as it is difficult in the
contrary. This accounts for European sailing vessels so
rarely reaching Suez; they proceed only as far as Djidda,
and that only when coming from India or at the time of the
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>I had to spend two hot days on board while my baggage
was disembarked. Whoever has been to India knows well
enough what is the furnace temperature of the Red Sea, and
how, south of the tropic of Cancer, it becomes insufferable.
The thermometer stood at midday at about 95° Fahrenheit,
and the air was like a vapour-bath. The sea water, a few
degrees cooler, afforded us, nevertheless, some refreshment,
and we did our utmost to enjoy it at all hours of the day.
Still there was something very enervating and depressing
about this amphibious life. Had the heat and sun-glare been
less overpowering, we might have truly enjoyed the splashing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and sport in the bright green floods which spread over the
shallows where coral banks ranged themselves below, and
where the eye could detect a thousand marvels. Like terraces
filled with the choicest plants, the sloping beds of coral
descended with variegated festoons into the purple shades of
the deep; strange forms were witnessed in these living
groves, and conspicuous among others was the “bride of the
fish,” which is celebrated in the Arabian fishing-song, “O
bride, lovely bride of the fish, come to me.” Ever and anon
on my voyage, which was to me as an Odyssey, did I delight
to catch fragments of this song, as it was dreamily hummed
by the man at the stern during the hot midday hour when
the crew had sunk into slumber, and while, noiselessly and
spirit-like, our vessel glided through the emerald floods.
The enchantment, as of a fairy tale, of these waters with their
myriad living forms of every tint and shape, defies all power
of description.</p>

<p>Without entering the town, I lost no time in putting off to
sea in my little Arab craft. At first we made little headway,
but after noon a fresh breeze came from the north-east, which
continued all night, so that by the following morning, after a
voyage of nearly 100 miles in twenty hours, we slackened
sail under the mountains which I had previously visited, in
lat. 21° <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> The Nubian coast was almost close in front of
us. A very primitive kind of compass enabled us to steer to
this goal. I was glad to find that no water had reached my
baggage, for in the heavy sea the boat had rolled and pitched
considerably. We ran along the coast, and each familiar
scene revived in me pleasant memories of my former journey,
which had been unmarred by a single trouble. Close in
view was Cape Roway, where the formation of a lagoon had
developed natural salt-works, from which is obtained the salt
for the consumption at Djidda, and for export to India. The
salt, however, is only secured during the eight hottest
months of the year, when the Red Sea is reduced to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
lowest level, two or three feet below its altitude in the winter.
The only explanation of this phenomenon seems to be the
prevalent direction of the wind taken in connection with the
position of the water. The bearings of the sea are such that
the wind drives the waves with full force towards the Straits
of Mandeb, the narrowness of which retards the outflow of
the water and produces an immense evaporation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUBMARINE MEADOW.</div>

<p>The flat shore between the mountains and the sea with its
coral reefs was hidden from our view. A green carpet of
samphire covered the coast for miles along the land. This
botanically may be represented as coming under the genus
Suæda, the name of which is imitated from the Arab “sued,”
the original of our “soda.” This plant has long been turned
to a profitable account, and to this day Arab boats may be seen
about the coast, engaged in the procuring and preserving of it.</p>

<p>Rising directly out of the water close to the shore grow in
patches great clusters of Avicennia, so abundant in tropical
seas, the beautiful laurel-leaf of which forms a dazzling
contrast to the bare brown of the mainland.</p>

<p>Over considerable tracts at the depth of thirty feet the
sea bottom resembles a submarine meadow, rich with every
species of sea-grass: in these, turtles and dujongs, which are so
numerous in this part of the Red Sea, find their pasture land.
It must be a very protracted business for these cumbrous
creatures to get their sustenance, bit by bit, from these tender
leaflets; but they have time enough and nothing else to do.</p>

<p>The little islets in the height of summer are the resort of
flocks of water-birds who go there to breed undisturbed. On
one of these, in July 1864, we collected over 2000 eggs of the
tern, although the dry area above the strand consisted of
scarcely so many square feet. At the approach of night the
wind failed us, and with fluttering sails we drifted into sight of
a place called Durroor. Two antique Turkish guard-houses of
small dimensions gleamed with their white walls far across
the sea. They are not unlike the rough-walled watch-towers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of our fortresses, and are said to have been built by Selim II.
when Yemen was subdued; they are the scanty remains of a
past which continues to the present, isolated memorials of a
barren, inhospitable coast, where all is changeless as the
rolling waves.</p>

<p>I shall not easily forget the nights which I passed becalmed
upon that sea. Sleep there could be none. Drenched in
perspiration, one could only sit by his lamp and indulge the
hope that the breeze at daybreak might be somewhat cooler.
Air and sea combined to form an interminable mass of
vapour through which the moon could only penetrate with a
lurid silvery gleam. One bright strip alone cleaves itself a
way over the silent waves; it stretches towards an aperture
in the horizon, which would seem to be the origin of all the
brightness: but all is full of strange illusion, for the moon is
here above our heads. The boat floats as though it were an
aërial vessel in a globe of vapour; the depth of the sea,
illumined by the vertical beams of the moon, is like another
sky beneath us, and hosts of mysterious beings, diversified in
colour and confused in form, are moving underneath our feet.
The calmness of the air and the unbroken stillness of this
spectral nature increased the magic of these moonlight nights.</p>

<p>Late in the evening of the third day we ran into the
harbour of Suakin. This town, formerly held directly
subject to the Turkish power, had three years since, together
with Massowa and the adjacent coast, been surrendered to the
Viceroy of Egypt. In that short time it had remarkably
improved. Formed by nature to serve as a harbour for the
Egyptian Soudan, and even for Abyssinia, the place, as long
as its administration came from Arabia and Constantinople,
could inevitably never rise, and even now its prosperity is
only comparative. The Egyptian Government still obstructs
all traffic by the heavy duties which it levies even on the
natural intercourse with Suez; it is desirous of transferring
its interests as a centre to Massowa, watching continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
with attentive eyes the ungoverned condition of Abyssinia.
Since the traffic on the Nile by way of Berber ever continues
in uninterrupted activity, and this place lies but 200 miles
from Suakin, whilst the distance between Massowa and
Khartoom is twice as far, why any preference should be
given to Massowa is altogether incomprehensible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUAKIN.</div>

<p>I was now visiting Suakin for the fourth time, and the
Governor received me very graciously as an old acquaintance.
He sent immediately for some camels, which I required for
the continuation of my journey. He himself had to leave
the town on the following day to visit his summer abode in
the neighbouring mountains. There still remained to me
four months before commencing my real journey from Khartoom,
as the voyage up the White Nile could not begin until
December or January; I resolved to fill up the interval by a
tour through the mountains of South Nubia, for the purpose
of accustoming myself to the heat and fatigue of a harmless
climate, before exposing myself to the fever atmosphere of
Khartoom and the Upper Nile districts. Just at this time
of year, too, the valleys between the Red Sea and the Nile
promised me a rich booty, and I hoped to obtain a remuneration
for any toil on my part by the botanical varieties which
were to be looked for on the elevated ridges. I could not do
otherwise than rejoice in the prospect of escape from the
glowing oven of Suakin towards the western horizon, where
the mountain-chains, veiled in grey vapour, betrayed the
refreshing rains which favoured the district and rendered it
so preferable for my sojourn. At night was heard the roll
of distant thunder, and the darkness was broken at intervals
by flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September at daybreak all was ready.
After the lapse of two years passed in the domestic comforts
of Europe, it is not altogether easy to remount the “ship of
the desert.” Our first day’s march was through a trying
country. The plain indeed was uniformly level, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
twelve miles it was covered with such huge black boulders
glowing with the heat, that progress was very difficult.
After we had proceeded about nine miles from the town, we
made a short midday halt under the miserable shade of some
dry acacias, which were like the uncovered skeletons of
parasols. As if in despair they stretched their leafless
branches towards the sky, and seemed to implore for water.
Exposed here in a leathern pipe to the wind, our drinking
water soon cooled down to a temperature about 18° below
the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p>The coast plains, although practically level, evidently
slope very gradually down to the sea, for after a few hours’
march the town is seen like a white spot far below. Beyond
is the expanse of sea, which melts into the horizon. The
coast-ridges are on an average from 3000 to 4000 feet high,
but occasionally single peaks may rise to an altitude of 5000
feet. At one time they appear like a lofty wall, rising
abruptly from the slanting plane; at another like separate
piles of rock picturesquely grouped behind and over one
another. Our route awhile across the narrow promontory
now lay along the enclosure of a valley bounded by sloping
walls of granite. After twelve hours’ perseverance, on the
afternoon of the following day we reached the first mountain
pass, about 3000 feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAINS.</div>

<p>Infinitely refreshing was it to ascend at every step higher
into the mountain atmosphere, and to be raised above the
vapourous heat of the suffocating shore. There seemed a
requickening energy in every breath of air, as gratefully it
circulated on the heights. The real charm of such a change
could not be appreciated more than on the first night of
camping-out. Comfortably stretched upon the clean smooth
stones which form the valley, the weary limbs could find
repose; through the silent night the stars shed a bright and
kind encouragement; there was an aromatic odour floating
refreshingly around, for, impregnated with camphor, mint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and thyme, the air was laden with scents which the stores of
the perfumer could not rival, and such as no quarter of the
globe could surpass. The plants which exhale the welcome
aroma are little obscure mountain weeds, amongst which a
“pulicaria” plays an essential part. Noiselessly and like
spectres glided the camels on their soft feet through the
valley, rejoicing in the pasture, sweet and luscious after the
scanty herbage of the shore, where for them all was dearth
and salt and bitterness.</p>

<p>Solemnity reigned throughout nature; no discordant cry
of mountain bird, no howling beast of prey, disturbed the
traveller: there was only the delicate song of the desert
cricket to lull him into peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>The mountains between Suakin and Singat afford a habitat
for such numbers of remarkable plants that they appear for
their variety alone well worth a visit. The most striking
forms which arrest the attention of the uninitiated are the
Dracænæ and Euphorbiæ, remarkable as both are for their
fantastic shapes. They flourish on the loftiest heights, but
are found 2000 feet below, towards the valleys. The first
belong to those types of vegetation which (as though they
had been carried in the air and dropped from another world)
are limited to extremely narrow sections of the earth. The
first dragon-trees (<i lang="la">dracænæ</i>) which were observed in the
African continent, are those which are to be found on these
mountains alone, and even here only over an area of a few
square miles.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Nubian dracænæ, being only from 15 to
20 feet in height, are dwarfish in comparison with their
famous sister of Orotava in Teneriffe, but in other respects
there are only minute and subtle distinctions between them
and those which are found in the Canary Isles. In the
language of the native nomad tribes of the Hadendoa and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Bishareen, the dracæna is known as “To-Omba” or
“T’Ombet.” The leaves afford bast for cords, the long
flower stalks serve in June as excellent food for camels,
whilst for goats they are almost poison.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Another remarkable feature of this mountain-district is
the large number of succulent plants, the fantastic forms of
which here appropriately adorn the craggy walls of the
valley, and supply a needed decoration to the more barren
rocks of Southern Nubia.</p>

<p>In Abyssinia itself neither euphorbiæ nor aloes are ever
found at an altitude of less than 4000 feet. Here, beside the
giant Kolkwal, they are found much lower towards the valley.
Four smaller kinds of the same species, as well as some
remarkable Stapeliæ (which resemble the cactus type of the
euphorbiæ), flourish to the very summit of the mountains.
Found in company with them is a wild unearthly-looking
plant called the Caraïb (<i lang="la">Bucerosia</i>), of which the branches
are like wings, prickly and jagged round the edges like a
dragon’s back. They produce clusters of brown flowers as
large as one’s fist, which exhale a noxious and revolting
smell, the plants themselves being swollen with a white and
slimy poisonous juice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LASSAV.</div>

<p>No space may be found to enumerate all the varieties,
but I must mention the Seyleb (<i lang="la">Sanseviera</i>), whose fleshy
tender leaves provided the Nubian nomad with the ordinary
material for the cords with which he binds their burdens
on his camels. These leaves in shape are not unlike the
Nile whips, and on that account may readily recall and stir
up painful memories to the poor Nubian of the kurbatch of
the Turks, whenever he may chance to see them. So richly
burdened are the hanging rocks with the varieties of rarest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
plants; so large and multiform is the exhibition of scarce
and novel succulents—&#8203;that the greatest enthusiast could
hardly fail to be bewildered. As a most interesting development
of structural peculiarity, the Lassav, one of the Capparids,
demands some notice. It produces flowers which
take a form quite unique. A drawing taken from nature
shows the strange deformity of the petals, a double cluster
of which is attached to the one broad sepal, so as to produce
the effect of two handkerchiefs in one pocket.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>This rich covering of vegetation is, however, confined to
the side of the mountains towards the sea; on the other
side, as soon as the second pass is left behind, the rocks are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
bare, and only the lowest part of the valley is covered with
anything of luxuriant verdure. Acacias, growing so closely
as almost to form a hedge, and gigantic clumps of the grass-green
Salvadora, shoot up like great dishes of green salad
from the cheerless space around. The moistening vapour of
the sea does not reach here to clothe the parched and naked
rock. Such were the valleys through which on the morning
of the third day we passed on to complete the first stage of
our wanderings. Towards midday, after marching for nineteen
hours, we had reached Singat, the summer retreat of
the town Bedouins of Suakin.</p>

<p>The valley of Singat is about a league in breadth. It is
enclosed by two lofty mountain chains running parallel to the
coast, apparently joined by a number of projecting spurs.
On the broad sandy bed of the valley were erected scarcely
less than 500 of those Bedouin tents, of which the shape, in
their drooping folds, may be compared to what we see in the
breast of a roasted fowl. Here, at least a quarter of the population
of the town, which reckons 3000 souls, passes the
season of refreshing rains. Later, when the mountain valleys
are again dry and destitute of pasture, these transient habitations
are carried back again; and the camels and goats must
find their pasturage on the slopes in the vicinity of the town,
which are exposed to the action of the damp sea air.</p>

<p>Here, at his usual resort, I met Muntass Bey, the Governor
of Suakin. His residence consisted of a Sammor-acacia, with
foliage wide-spreading like a parasol. Under the shadow of
this commodious and airy roof, common to all, was served
the midday meal. Some tents in the immediate proximity
were provided as places of refuge from the rain. A storm
of unusual violence broke over us in the course of the day,
and changed the centre of the valley into a foaming torrent,
200 paces wide, for three hours; the flood rushed onwards
with unabated strength and sought the sea. I found shelter
in a guard-room built of blocks of stone and clay, the quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of the garrison of 200 Bazibozuks. After the rain the temperature
was lowered to a refreshing coolness, and on the following
morning I rejoiced to register a temperature of 68° F.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUMMER RETREATS.</div>

<p>Whilst I stayed in Singat, I always at dinner-time found
an open table beneath the Governor’s great tree. This was
rendered enjoyable not more by the skill of the cook than
by the harmony of the Egyptian singers, whom the Bey had
in his suite. The camels, which I had hired in Suakin, were
meanwhile sent away to the pastures in the neighbouring
valleys, to be recruited against their approaching fatigues.
The camel drivers were by no means in a hurry to start, as
time was not of the smallest value to them. A trip of five
days in the lofty mountains of Erkoweet, eight or ten leagues
to the south-east of Singat, unclosed to my researches the
vegetable treasures of this most northerly spur of the Abyssinian
highland, hitherto unexplored; and was full of enjoyment,
equally beneficial both to mind and body.</p>

<p>Erkoweet is another summer retreat for the people of
Suakin. The valley in which the tents are pitched is called
Harrasa, and discloses the whole flora of the Abyssinian
highland in wonderful and complete luxuriance. Euphorbiæ
and dracænæ deck the mountains in masses which might
almost be reckoned by millions, so that the slopes in the
distance have the appearance of being covered with huge
black patches. From amongst innumerable projections of
granite, mostly dome-shaped and adorned with charming
foliage, there juts forth one huge slanting mass of mountain,
which is probably the highest elevation of the district of
Suakin, if not of the entire chain which runs along the coast.
I ascended this peak nearly 6000 feet in altitude, and was
amply repaid for the exertion by the magnificent prospect
before me. There was extreme enjoyment in the freshness
of the air. The whole contour of the coast lay stretched in
clear and perfect outline. The whole confused system of the
mountains of the coast lay like a map below my feet. In a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
circumference of seventy miles I plainly recognised single
masses, so that the peaks known to me in my earlier visits
served as landmarks to inform me of my true position.</p>

<p>As the result of several favourable meteorological combinations,
there exists in these loftier elevations a more
luxuriant development of vegetation than in any of the
neighbouring mountain districts of South Nubia, which have
a lower altitude. This is illustrated very plainly by the
clusters of beard-moss (<i lang="la">Usnea</i>) which hang on every twig and
branch, by the abundance of sulphur-coloured lichens on
every mass of rock, and likewise by the formation of numerous
luxuriant beds of moss. Mosses are generally deficient
alike in Egypt proper and in Nubia, and are scarcely seen
in the trenches and clefts of the Nile valley; their existence
is dependent on a minimum of moisture throughout the
year, which is there but rarely reached.</p>

<p>At Erkoweet I found again the wild olive tree, which I
had already discovered some years previously on the mountains
by the Elbe. I noticed that it assumes the same low
bushy shape here, and bears the same box-like foliage, as it
does on the coast ridges of the Mediterranean; when the
two are compared they exhibit a general identity, so that I
conclude the African and European are of the same family.
The olive tree, it is well known, is reckoned, like the fig
tree, as originally a product of the frontiers of Asia; in
remote antiquity, it was reverenced by Semitic nations, and
cultivated until it bore a rich produce. This type of vegetation
fails completely in the interior of the continent. In the
time of Homer the olive grew wild on the islands of the
Grecian Archipelago, and it is still to be met with, though
in an altered condition, on the coasts of Syria; but here on
the Red Sea it has remained unchanged for thousands of
years, and the famous classical tree of myth and song is
still undisturbed in the dreams of its youth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WATER-COURSES.</div>

<p>A bare boulder-flat of black hornblende stones, extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
several miles, divides the mountains of Erkoweet from those
which bound the valley of Singat on the east. The broad
water-courses which run between, show what must be the
prodigious volume and violence of the currents which occasionally
rush downwards to the sea. These deep water-courses
are, however, only periodically filled, and then only
for a few hours, in the course of the year, so that for some
months they are adapted for the cultivation of corn. Notwithstanding,
there was here but a very limited cultivation
of sorghum, the Arabian durra, since there is a difficulty in
securing labour. The idle nomads have no disposition for
agricultural employment, although famine in dry seasons,
when the flocks can nowhere find sufficient pasture, brings
back its recurring calamity. In the year before my last
visit, in the valleys about Singat alone, seventy men had
died literally of hunger, after vainly endeavouring for weeks
to subsist upon wild purslane.</p>

<p>All water-courses, with a supply of moist soil upon the
ground just sufficient for a few months, although they are
not enclosed by heights like valleys, are comprehended
within the Arab designation “el wady.” Cheerless through
the dry season, after the first rain their level sand flats are
clothed with the most luxuriant flora; fresh springing grasses
put forth their little cushion points, and give the sward the
appearance of being dotted with a myriad spikes; then
quickly come the sprouting blades, and all is like a waving
field of corn. Halfway between Singat and Erkoweet we
halted in a wady of this character, which bore the name of
Sarroweet. What a prospect! how gay with its variety of
hue, green and red and yellow! Nothing could be more
pleasant than the shade of the acacia, nothing more striking
than the abundance of bloom of the Abyssinian aloe, transforming
the dreary sand-beds into smiling gardens. Green
were the tabbes-grass and the acacias, yellow and red were
the aloes, and in such crowded masses, that I was involuntarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
reminded of the splendour of the tulip beds of the Netherlands;
but here gardens lay in the midst of a waste of
gloomy black stone. One special charm of a desert journey
is that it is full of contrasts, that it brings close together
dearth and plenty, death and life; it opens the eyes of the
traveller to the minutest benefits of nature, and demonstrates
how every enjoyment is allied to a corresponding deprivation.
Richly laden with treasures I returned to Singat, where I
remained until the 21st of September, and during my stay
I had once again repeated opportunities of studying my old
friends the people of Suakin in their domestic relations.</p>

<p>The coast lands on both sides of the Red Sea offer a
striking likeness to each other, which does not consist in
physical resemblances alone. The people are the same in
feeling and in manners, however much the true Ethiopians,
such as the Bishareen, Hadendoa, and Beni-Ammer, may
differ in language and descent from the true Arabs; I say
from the <em>true</em> Arabs, because the term Arab has been at
times too indiscriminately applied, and ought to be limited
to the nomads in Arabia, as distinguished from the settlers.
On both coasts the inhabitants follow the same character of
life. They are people of the deserts, wandering shepherds,
and procure whatever corn they may require from external
sources. Even the town life of the Arabs is essentially half
a camp life. As a collateral illustration of this I may remark
that to this day in Malta, where an Arab colony has reached
as high a degree of civilisation as ever yet it has attained,
the small towns, which are inhabited by this active little
community, are called by the very same designations as elsewhere
belong to the nomad encampments in the desert.
Half Suakin is like a desert camp, and for this reason I have
called its inhabitants town Bedouins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWN BEDOUINS.</div>

<p>These town Bedouins are people whose only distinction
from the Bedouins of the mountains is that their dress almost
always is of a spotless white; the true sons of the desert, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
consequence of their continual camp life, have long toned
down the colour of their single garment, never washed, to a
brownish-grey, quite in harmony with the general hue of the
surrounding country. Many very beautiful faces, perfectly
regular in feature, are to be found amongst these swarthy
Bedouins, whilst a wonderful dignity and elegance mark
their movements. Like the inhabitants of Hedjas and Yemen
they chew tobacco, and find recreation in various amusements
which are unknown to the mountain Bedouins. All alike,
however, have in common the same single aim of existence:
to do as little as possible, to sleep much, to drink goats’
milk, to eat sheep’s flesh, and finally to scrape together all
the Maria Theresa dollars that they can; the latter is a
matter of some difficulty, on account of their natural idleness.
Black female slaves instead of asses, which in Suakin
would cost too much to feed, are indispensable to them for
carrying water from the well to the town. Whoever possesses
fifty dollars in his bag and has one slave besides his
water-bearer, is quite a magnate, and spends much labour
in the profuse adornment of his hair. When he is not sleeping,
that is to say, in the cool hours of the morning and
evening, he takes his walk, always bareheaded and with
high-towering locks, here and there on the road joining in
a conversation or conferring the favours of his weighty
counsel. When it becomes too hot in Suakin, and the goats
give no more milk, after the last weed has been devoured,
and the last tundup (sodada) eaten to the roots by the camels,
they leave the cob-webbed thorn hedges of their farms, pack
together the acacia-rods and date-mats, the materials of the
tent, and withdraw to the mountain pastures, which they
retain by ancestral right. After them follow the Turkish
soldiers, who roam through the valleys, switching their kurbatch,
and proceed to collect the taxes levied in proportion
to the number of cattle. The services of these officials in
return are enlisted to re-capture any camel stealers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
may be seeking to escape to the remote solitudes of the
mountains.</p>

<p>On the 21st of September I resumed my journey towards
the Nile, a further distance of 175 miles. On the way
my little party, which, besides the camel drivers, consisted
of only a native of Berber and a dog which I had brought
from Europe, was increased by falling in with two young
pilgrims on their way from Mecca. I was unable to complete
my proper retinue until I should reach Khartoom, since
the men who had offered me their services in Egypt appeared
so weakly that I considered them unfit for undertaking any
journey into Central Africa. The addition therefore of
these two blacks for the approaching march of sixteen
days through mountain solitudes was very welcome. Their
armour consisted of a Turkish sabre, and this, together with
my gun, seemed completely sufficient protection against the
natives, whom Sir Samuel Baker a few years before had so
successfully mastered with the help of an umbrella, that a
considerable number of them voluntarily laid down their
arms. The vigilance of the dog was a security against any
nocturnal attack, and indeed, at two different times he had
given warning to my little caravan just at the right time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RIVAL WIVES.</div>

<p>Less welcome to me was the company of a disagreeable
old fanatic, who, followed by two wives, was on his return
journey from the Holy City of the East to his home in the
far west. He was a priest from Kano in Haussa, and when
he told of the wonders of the world which he had seen on
his long journeys, I could always set him right, having really
seen infinitely more than he had. I completely non-plussed
him by my geographical knowledge of the Western Soudan,
and after the details which I gave of that country, he was,
however reluctantly, at last obliged to believe that I had
actually been there. But any friendship between us was
rendered impossible by the constant noise and contention
caused by his wives. All amicable relations came utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
to an end when I found myself driven as I did to come forward
as the champion of the oppressed. Of the priest’s two
wives, one had faithfully followed her husband from his
home, and now saw herself supplanted by the other, whom
the priest had married at the tomb of the Prophet. The
fellow had begun to impose on his first wife in the most
shameful manner by the withdrawal of every choice morsel
and of every harmless indulgence; consequently the two
women were continually quarrelling, and literally laid on to
each other by the hair. The man himself always took the
part of the new wife, and cruelly maltreated the old. At
last it became too much for me to be the daily witness of
such revolting scenes, and I took the old sinner to task, and
tried to inculcate in him due ideas of woman’s rights and
dignity, so that he could tell his countrymen in Haussa what
we thought on such matters. The indifferent camel drivers
and the still more indifferent camels, both alike as unmoved
as the black rocks in their solemn stateliness, alone surveyed
this little tragedy. Whoever has to travel through deserts
should endeavour to be free from such rabble and useless
retinue. A large company is troublesome on account of the
scarcity of shade, since there is not always time at the
halting-places to pitch a tent, and one must avail himself of
the few larger trees which exist in the valleys.</p>

<p>A stiff ascent of the road at a short distance from Singat
led westwards to the water-shed between the Nile and the
Red Sea. The elevated pass is rather to the rear of the
defiles on the Suakin side. We then descended to a very
broad wady full of pasture, called O-Mareg, which was a third
summer retreat for the natives of Suakin. In the middle of
a green valley; two miles broad, some fifty tents were
erected, all under the surveillance of a Turkish captain with
some soldiers to look after the interests of the Government.
Great herds of camels, cows, sheep, and goats, and amongst
them several hundreds of asses, were grazing in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
direction. The Wady O-Mareg does not form, as might be
expected, a tributary of the great mountain-river Langeb,
which at its recurring period joins the Barka, but takes its
course direct to the Atbara, as do all the larger water-courses
of the ensuing road.</p>

<p>In consequence of the repeated storms of rain, at the time
of my journey there was water in nearly all the valleys,
and everywhere there was abundance of pasture for the
camels. The drivers accordingly chose a more direct road
running to the south of the ordinary route of the caravans.
This enabled me to fill up my map with many new details.
As a general rule the drivers followed the rule of never, if
possible, encountering the native shepherds on the road.
Although they were of the same race, they feared the conflicts
which were frequently unavoidable in the neighbourhood
of any wells. I was not surprised at their timidity, as
I had myself experienced some difficulty in my former tour.</p>

<p>Having crossed the third chain, we reached the great
wady Amet, which is bounded on the north by Mount
O-Kurr, a colossal mass visible as a landmark in the west for
a whole day’s journey. The predominating rocks are greenstone
in several varieties, although beautiful serpentine is far
from infrequent. In one part of the valley rises a homogeneous
mass of splendid porphyry nearly 1000 feet in height,
brilliantly marked on its surface with veins of Indian red.
From the <a id="chg1"></a>prevaence in these mountains of greenstone,
which no doubt often contains a grass-green stratum, the
conclusion must not be drawn that green is at all a prevailing
colour of the walls of rock. This is by no means the case;
indeed, nearly all kinds of rock, however diverse they may
appear when broken, are covered externally with an uniform
dark brown, which obliterates all distinctive shades. In
its interior the greenstone is unpolished and of bright
colour. A superficial accretion, the cause of which remains
hitherto unexplained, forms itself on every fragment and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
gives a coating about a millimeter thick, in colour not unlike
a bright brown cake of chocolate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BISHAREEN GOATS AND SHEEP.</div>

<p>In Wady Amet we lighted upon some sorghum-fields,
which seem to have been planted out, like those at O-Mareg
and Erkoweet, by way of experiment; but in reality they
here represented the whole exertions of the idle inhabitants
of the desert. Some primitive huts, heaped up in Cyclopean
rudeness, bore witness to the stability of this rendezvous of
native shepherds. We were here amply provided with milk
and meat, goats and sheep being alike abundant in the
neighbouring valleys. Camel-breeding is not carried on
here so much as in the northern parts of Etbai, as the whole
district of the Bishareen between the Nile and the sea is
called; the breeders avoiding the proximity of the great
roads through fear of the foraging and reprisals of the
military.</p>

<p>The goats of the country form a small race of their own
and belong to the comprehensive variety which is called the
Ethiopian. Differing from those of the Nile valley, they
are again found among all the nomad people in the interior;
the goats of the Dinka being a larger kind of the same
character. The Ethiopian goat may be reckoned among the
most agile and elegant of the race, and it might be called
the climbing goat, since it prefers to feed on the young
shoots of the acacia, and for that purpose often climbs up the
slanting stems or low-growing branches. A large flock
occasionally groups itself round a tree with pendant branches:
in that case, the animals are rarely seen in any other position
than standing upright on their hind legs, and give at a distance
an impression that they must be a crowd of men. Others
may be observed in grotesque attitudes, with legs straddling,
hanging in mid-air, and weighing down the boughs of an
acacia.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br>
 <img src="images/i_034.jpg"
 alt="Bishareen Sheep">
 <p class="caption">A Bishareen Sheep.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The Bishareen keep larger flocks of sheep than of goats;
the breed is very peculiar, marked by distinctions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
might almost constitute a nationality. The Etbai race is
closely allied to the thick-tailed species in all general characteristics,
but distinguished by the lissome condition of its
long and bushy tail. The fleece is hardly worthy of being
called wool at all, for it simply consists of rather long
straight hair. Almost all are perfectly white, except (and
this is the chief mark of distinction in the species) on the
ancles and mouth, which are covered with black hair. The
usual price in the country for such sheep never exceeds a
Maria Theresa dollar (four shillings), whilst young lambs
cost but half this sum. Cattle are found only in the
environs of Suakin and on the road to Taka, lying further
south than the one on which we travelled. On the route
which we took, in consequence of the smaller rainfall, the
pasture necessary for their maintenance is not permanent
throughout the year, like it is in the lands adjacent to the
Barka basin. In the next district we crossed a high level,
intersected by numerous water-courses deeply worn amidst
the stones and rubble. The most considerable of all these
water-courses periodically flowing to the south-west, was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Wady Arab. The dry bed of this was bounded by shelving
banks from 40 to 50 feet in height, and the ascent was
steep enough to demand no small exertion from our laden
camels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCHWEINFURTHIA.</div>

<p>Here grew in great abundance the plant, a species of
Scrophulariaceæ, to which my own name had been assigned
(<i lang="la">Schweinfurthia pterosperma</i>). It met me as a greeting from
my distant home. In itself it is but an insignificant little
weed, but upon its discovery, Alexander Braun, the celebrated
professor of the University of Berlin, had named it in
my honour—&#8203;a little token of remembrance, which, according
to the tribute of Linnæus, may be more lasting than any
memorial in brass or marble.</p>

<p>A hollow, as of a saddle-seat, between the mountains led
us over the chain, unbroken by a pass, of the fourth of the
parallel mountain ridges which, with many branches, traverse
this part of Africa. To the right on the north we left
Mount Wowinte and the peak of Badab in which it culminates
at an altitude of 5000 feet. The road then descended
into the wide plain spreading to the west of this height,
where a magnificent panorama opened to the view. Next
we reached the Wady Habohb, a watercourse of which the
breadth was about 400 feet. Proceeding across Wady
Kokreb, two miles wide, we arrived at length at the equally
wide Wady Yumga. By this time we were on the next line
of the mountain range, in which is situated the much frequented
well of Koway, a rendezvous for all the nomads who
wander in the neighbouring localities. Here, by order of the
great Sheikh of the Hadendoa, a tribute, sanctioned by the
Egyptian Government, is levied on every caravan that
passes.</p>

<p>My lazy camel drivers used every available opportunity to
prolong the duration of the journey. For my part I was
indifferent to this, as I had time at my disposal, and my
enjoyment of the flora fully occupied me; my companions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
however, were not so patient. They longed for their
cherished Nile to put an end to this camp-life in dreary
deserts. At length even my own forbearance was exhausted;
the excuses became intolerable: at one time the camels had
run away, at another they wanted food, so that it grew up to
a regular fight between us four and the dozen Bedouins who
were conducting us. Some sticks, the single Turkish sabre,
and an indestructible pipe tube, which I swung in my hand,
were our only weapons, but they sufficed to turn the victory
to our side. My tube smashed a number of patriarchal
shepherd staves, and thus an end was put to the eternal
halts and feeds, and we went on towards the west at a better
pace. I thought of the proverb that the European in India
either learns patience or loses it.</p>

<p>As we followed the Wady Laemeb with the water of its
channel now replaced by verdure, we come to O-Fik, the last
mountain on the route, beyond which a desert, unrefreshed
by a single spring, extends as far as the Nile valley. The
last well was that of O-Baek. We lighted here upon
some Bishareen families, who were staying temporarily with
their flocks in the neighbourhood of the well, and were accustomed
after the first rain to sow a considerable piece of
ground with sorghum. Amongst the men may be observed
expressive features, well developed, unlike ours, yet less
unlike them than the other inhabitants of the Nile valley.
But more frightful creatures than the women of these
nomads there surely cannot be on earth. Of course I speak
only of those who have passed the spring-time of their life.
They are lean beyond all conception, and as haggard as their
goats would be if shorn of their hair, which alone gives any
roundness to their gaunt frames. There is nothing about
them even of that natural delicacy of many savages which
makes the children of the desert appear like the gazelle,
which is clean, though it never bathes. Physically and
morally they are loathsome; toothless, mangy, inquisitive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
and chattering; in a word, they are the very incorporation
of the infirmities of senility.</p>

<p>From this place it required an energetic march of twenty
leagues to reach the first well on the confines of the Nile-valley.
The road, now formed by numerous pathways
running closely side by side like cattle-ruts, crossed a great
boulder flat in a <abbr title="west south-west">W.S.W.</abbr> direction. The pack-camels proceeded
side by side in phalanx, as upon the open lands they
rarely march in single file. There were sandy water-courses
ever and again intersecting our way, and groups of hills
meeting the eye in the horizon.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<div class="sidenote">MONUMENT OF NATURE.</div>

<p>On leaving O-Baek we had next to traverse the plains
extending to the west of the wells; formed of the finest
quicksand, blown up into hills often as high as a house, these
sands were a considerable impediment to the camels. From
the dreary waste of the plain with its loose black rocks,
jutted up a solitary block of granite, to which the Bedouins
give the suggestive name of “Eremit.” An hour’s journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
further on there appeared, above the plain by the right of
the road, another isolated mass of granite, one of those
landmarks visible from afar, which, after the weariness
of the desert journey, is ever greeted gratefully by the eye of
the long-tried traveller. It is a natural stone obelisk, 35 feet
high, in its singular shape resembling an inverted pear or fig.
The block is narrow at the base, and evidently in the course
of time has been worn away by the action of the sand as it
has been driven by the wind.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This monument, the unhewn
production of nature itself, is called by the natives Aboo-Odfa,
Odfa being the name of a saddle covered with a canopy which
is used for women on the camel. Smaller blocks of similar
conformation are not unfrequently met with at other parts of
the road.</p>

<p>On the grassy bottom of Aboo-Kolod, where, in consequence
of the late rain, great pools had formed themselves, we made
our last night camp but one. The slopes had all the characteristics
of being on the level of the Nile at Berber, whilst
the remainder of the road again ascends. The last wady is
Aboo-Selem; it was at that time one unbroken sorghum-field,
its fruitful soil was already cultivated by the industrious
inhabitants of the Nile valley, although the recurrence of the
rain would permit the culture only at intervals. At length
on the 7th of October we entered the town of Berber. Without
loss of time I found a boat on which to continue my
journey to Khartoom.</p>

<p>Whilst I encamped at Berber, pending my embarkation on
the Nile, I had been unconsciously put into a position of
some jeopardy. The native of Dongola who accompanied
me as my servant, in order to find the safest place he could
to secure the prohibited wares of a Greek merchant from the
eyes of the police, had, without my knowledge, concealed
under my tent a considerable quantity of gunpowder and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
other explosive materials. Whilst the fellow was away on
a visit to town, I had unsuspiciously kindled a fire on the
loose sandy soil, in order to perform my cooking operations,
little dreaming of the peril which happily I escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOSPITALITY.</div>

<p>My old acquaintance, <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Lafargue, who was settled in
Berber as a merchant and presided over the French Vice-consulate,
himself an experienced traveller on the Upper
Nile, received me with that hearty hospitality which many
other desert wanderers have proved besides myself. Sir
Samuel Baker aptly compares such receptions to the oasis in
the desert. No necessity of letters of introduction here as
with us in Europe; no hollow forms of speech, exchanging
courtesies which perchance mean the very reverse; no empty
compliment of at best a tedious dinner; but here in
Egypt the people receive us with free and genial amiability,
all Europeans are fellow citizens and everything is true and
hearty. “What pleases me the most is the ease with which
you travel in this country; you come, you go, you return
again, as though it were a walk.” Such were <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Lafargue’s
cordial words to me. We parted well pleased with one
another: I shall not see him again.</p>

<p>About the last part of the journey to Khartoom, which
embraces the passage up the Nile, and which is sufficiently
well known by the descriptions of other travellers, I have
nothing new to relate. By the complete failure of wind,
much of this portion of my journey was so exceptionally prolonged,
that it took sixteen days to accomplish the whole.
For the first part of the voyage, as far as Shendy and
Matamma, the only considerable towns in this district, the
shore offered nothing attractive. It reminded me of the
Egyptian valley of the Nile only in two places; the mouth
of the Atbara, and one spot where the renowned pyramids of
Meroe formed a noble background.</p>

<p>Matamma is a populous town, but extremely slow and
dull. The buildings, constructed of Nile earth, are insignificant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
in themselves, and irregularly crowded together in a
mass like huge ant-hills; not a single tree affords its shade
to the dreary streets, which are filthy with dirt.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">ennui</i> and the calm which obliged us to lay to here,
suggested all sorts of unprofitable vagaries to my servant
Arbab. He received from me part of his wages, and took a
wife on the spot from amongst the circle of his kinsfolk.
The bride, two days afterwards, was given back to herself
and her relations, to await indefinitely, for a year and a day,
the expected return of her husband. Arbab had already
been several times married in Khartoom; and at every
return he repeated the same usual, one may almost say, the
becoming custom.</p>

<p>The second half of the Nile voyage was, however, rich in
the charms of scenery. This is especially applicable to the
views afforded by the river islands. These islands are so
many throughout the whole extent of the sixth cataract,
between the island of Marnad and the lofty mountain-island
of Rowyan, that no one pretends to know their precise
number, and the sailors call them, in consequence, the
ninety-nine islands. This excursion offers to the traveller
a most attractive prospect, and the landscapes on shore
afford a treat which no other river voyage could surpass.
Splendid groups of acacias, in three varieties, with groves of
the holy-thorn, overgrown by the hanging foliage of graceful
climbers, made the profusion of islands set in the surface of
the water appear like bright-green luxuriant and gay tangles.
Wildly romantic, on the contrary, reminding one of the
Binger-loch, are the valley-straits of Sablook, where the
Nile, narrowed to a small mountain stream, flows between
high bare granite walls which rise some hundred feet.</p>

<p>So much the more surprising appeared the breadth which
the Nile exhibits above this cataract, where it displays itself
in a majesty which it has long lost in Egypt. Below their
confluence, the waters of the Blue and the White Nile are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
distinctly visible many miles apart. It is highly probable
that at certain times the level of the streams might show a
difference of several feet; the proposed establishment of a
Nilometer should therefore take place below the confluence,
in order that with the help of the telegraph accurate intelligence
of its condition might be remitted to Cairo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PITIABLE CONDITION OF NUBIANS.</div>

<p>In the Nubian Nile-valley all charm is gone. Extremely
wretched is the aspect of the country, and equally pitiable
are its present social conditions. In the course of the last
ten years, as a consequence, first, of the increased taxation,
and secondly, of the diminished production, matters have
continually become worse and worse. To the cursory glance
of a traveller only a small proportion of this deep-rooted
misery may be disclosed; he may perceive the consequences,
without being able to assign the reasons; and from the contradictory
statements of the inhabitants, he can hardly form
a clear idea of the real condition of the country. On the
other hand, the complaints of the people give him an incomplete
representation of the circumstances, unless he at the
same time takes notice of the objections which the Government
appears justified in raising against them. Only a
thorough knowledge of the country combined with local
study would put him in a position to form an opinion. In
spite of everything, the fact remains that the culture of the
soil is declining, that scarcity is everywhere on the increase,
and that distress is consequently more frequent. In the
last two months of this year’s harvest, the market price of a
rup<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of sorghum-corn had risen to a Maria Theresa dollar.
Three years before, large villages had been pointed out to
me, lying completely deserted on account of the emigration
of the inhabitants, and now again similar evidence of distress
was forced upon my notice. In the district between Damer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and Shendy, the population seemed utterly scared at the
increasing emigrations. The unmarried men go to Khartoom
in order to be enlisted as so-called soldiers by the merchants
on the Upper Nile. The elder people, on the other hand,
leave their culture, and with a few sheep or goats endeavour
to lead a meagre nomad life as shepherds in the steppes and
deserts.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November, at midday, we at last reached
Khartoom, and landed on the bank, which was all alive with
hundreds of boats. The German Vice-consul, Herr Duisberg,
who had shown me so much kindness at the time of my
former visit, again received me most hospitably. In his
elegant and commodious house, I had every opportunity for
rest and refreshment in anticipation of my coming labours.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> Egypt, in well-informed circles, it was a current opinion
that the Government was trying, on principle, to throw
impediments in the way of any explorers who might purpose
penetrating the district of the Upper Nile. It was supposed
that they were desirous of preventing the circulation, by
eye-witnesses, of adverse reports, and of keeping back from
the eyes of the world any undesirable details as to the
position of matters with reference to the slave trade. They
were unwilling to let it be seen that their influence over the
people of Khartoom was insufficient for the suppression of
the slave traffic amongst them. Under this impression I
entered upon my journey with some misgiving, entertaining
no very sanguine hopes as to the real utility of the order
delivered to me for the Governor-General of Khartoom, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
at that time was administering affairs with considerable
vigour in all the provinces of the Soudan under the
Egyptian dominion above the first cataract.</p>

<p>So much the more grateful, therefore, was my surprise
when, immediately after my arrival in Khartoom, I was
honoured by a visit from the powerful Dyafer Pasha, and,
after the first few words, satisfied myself that there was a
reasonable expectation that, on this occasion, the local
government would do all within their power to secure the
most complete protection to a scientific expedition.</p>

<p>My letter of recommendation from the Academy was
afterwards read in the Government divan. It was fluently
translated, sentence by sentence, into Arabic by the
physician in ordinary, and the Pasha at once declared that
he would be the Vokil, that is to say, the manager of affairs,
for the Academy of Berlin, and promised that he would not
fail to afford me the necessary assistance for my journey.
How faithfully he kept his word is well known, and on that
account the thanks of the Academy of Science were formally
presented to him. Dyafer had been an old captain of a
frigate in the stirring times of Mohammed Ali; he was a
man of considerable attainments, and had already become
known to me on the occasion of my first journey, when he
acted as Governor of Upper Egypt. In his house were seen
piles of atlases and anatomical plates; he was not wanting
in a clear comprehension of, nor indeed in an actual interest
in, my undertaking. He expressed his hope that my journey
might accomplish its aim, and if anything of material benefit
should be discovered that it might not be reserved, but
freely communicated to the State. I assured him that the
Royal Academy had no narrow views, and that he might be
certain that although I trusted by prosecuting science to
gain credit for myself, I should not overlook anything that
might be honourable to him, or for the advantage of his
Government. The Pasha seemed gratified by my reply, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
referred me to the writers, who were to settle the various
covenants of my agreement with an ivory trader, Ghattas, a
Coptic Christian. The Governor-General himself had
arranged the terms, and I could find little in their tenor
that would be adverse to my interests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRELIMINARY COVENANTS.</div>

<p>Besides Ghattas, there were several other merchants in
Khartoom, who possessed large settlements in the district of
the Upper Nile, but he alone amongst them was not a
Mahommedan; the others were, for the most part, true
Osmanlis, whose reputation, with respect to slave dealing, did
not stand too high. Thus the choice of the administrator fell
upon the unlucky Ghattas, who, being also the richest of all,
was required to become surety against any misadventure that
might occur to the traveller in the interior. If he were
betrayed to the cannibals, or if he were left in the lurch
among savages and cut-throats, so much the better for the
treasury of the Government, who would have the most
legitimate reasons for proceeding to the confiscation of his
estates.</p>

<p>I should fail to discharge a duty of gratitude if I were to
omit to acknowledge the interest displayed in behalf of my
enterprise by Herr Duisberg, who was at that time Vice-consul
of the North German Confederation in Khartoom.
Not only did he entertain me most hospitably for several
weeks in his house, but likewise exerted all his influence on
his friends the ivory-traders, so as to dispose them favourably
to my undertaking, and to relieve them from any fear of
interference on my part with their affairs.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any prejudice which might attach to him
as the leader of the Protestant mission, the Vice-consul had
gained the esteem of all parties in Khartoom, and was
especially in favour with the Governor-General, who very
thoroughly appreciated his integrity. His conciliating
manners availed to satisfy the Khartoom merchants that my
plan was not adverse to their interests. Hitherto they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
looked upon every scientific traveller as a dangerous spy,
whose visit only aimed at denouncing their transactions on
the Upper Nile, and reporting them to the Consul-General
in Egypt. On this occasion they consented to meet me at a
sumptuous entertainment given by Herr Duisberg before my
departure. All the gentry of the town, Pashas and Beys,
glittering with their stars and orders, and merchants, in their
gorgeous satin robes, gathered together at that feast of reconciliation
between the representatives of African commerce
and of European science.</p>

<p>The entire ivory trade of Khartoom is in the hands of six
larger merchants, with whom are associated a dozen more
whose business is on a smaller scale. For years the annual
export of ivory has not exceeded the value of 500,000 Maria
Theresa dollars. There has been a continual decrease in
the yield of ivory from the territory adjacent to the river, so
that last year, even that sum would not have been maintained,
unless the expeditions had, season after season, been
penetrating deeper into the more remote districts of the
interior. It is a fallacy to suppose that the pursuit of
elephants is merely a secondary consideration in these enterprises
of the Khartoom merchants, or that it only serves as a
cloke to disguise the far more lucrative slave trade. These
two occupations have far less to do with one another than is
frequently supposed. If it had not been for the high value
of ivory, the countries about the sources of the Nile would
even now be as little unfolded to us as the equatorial centre
of the great continent: they are regions which of themselves
could produce absolutely nothing to remunerate transport.
The settlements owe their original existence to the ivory
trade; but it must, on the other hand, be admitted that
these settlements in various ways have facilitated the operations
of the regular slave-traders. Without these depôts the
professional slave-traders could never have penetrated so far,
whilst now they are enabled to pour themselves into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
negro countries annually by thousands, on the roads over
Kordofan and Darfur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCHANT SERIBAS.</div>

<p>The merchants of Khartoom, to whom I have alluded,
maintain a great number of settlements in districts as near
as possible to the present ivory countries, and among peaceful
races devoted to agriculture. They have apportioned the
territory amongst themselves, and have brought the natives
to a condition of vassalage. Under the protection of an
armed guard procured from Khartoom, they have established
various depôts, undertaken expeditions into the interior, and
secured an unmolested transit to and fro. These depôts for
ivory, ammunition, barter-goods, and means of subsistence,
are villages surrounded by palisades, and are called Seribas.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Every Khartoom merchant, in the different districts where
he maintains his settlements, is represented by a superintendent
and a number of subordinate agents. These
agents command the armed men of the country, determine
what products the subjected natives must pay by way of
impost to support the guards, as well as the number of
bearers they must furnish for the distant exploring expeditions;
they appoint and displace the local managers; carry
on war or strike alliances with the chiefs of the ivory countries,
and once a year remit the collected stores to Khartoom.</p>

<p>Both the principal districts of the Khartoom ivory trade
are accessible by the navigation of the two source-affluents
together forming the White Nile, viz. the Bahr-el-Ghazal
and the Bahr-el-Gebel. The name Bahr-el-Abiad is understood
in Khartoom to include the entire domain of the Nile
and its affluents above this town, but in its true and more
limited sense it signifies only the united mainstream as far
as the mouth of the Sobat, “White Nile.” Two less important
centres are approached by the channels of the Sobat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the Giraffe. The landing-places, called Meshera, are in all
cases at a distance of some days’ journey from the depôts.
The trade winds and the rainy seasons both have their effect
in determining the time of year in which progress can be
made. They render the passage up stream practicable only
from December to January, and limit the valley journey to
June, July, and August. On the Bahr-el-Gebel the extreme
point of navigation is the well-known Gondokoro in lat 5° N.,
the termination of a series of voyages of discovery. On the
Bahr-el-Ghazal a kind of <i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i> leads to the only existing
Meshera. Beyond this, the Khartoom people have already
advanced 5° in a southerly, as well as in a westerly direction.
In the district of the Gazelle River, the Niam-niam countries
form a great source of the ivory-produce; of the ways
which were available, this was the direction which appeared
to promise the best opening for the prosecution of my object.
Accordingly, I determined to proceed by the Gazelle, and
concluded my contract with the Coptic Ghattas. He engaged
to supply the means of subsistence, and to furnish me with
bearers and an adequate number of armed men. He also
placed at my disposal a boat for the journey, and it was
expressly stipulated that I should be at liberty to join all the
enterprises and excursions of his own people.</p>

<p>The Governor-General laid similar obligations for my protection
on all the other chief merchants who had possessions
in the territory of the Gazelle. Duplicates of all the agreements
were prepared; one copy being retained by me, the
counterparts were deposited with the local government at
Khartoom. After these necessary provisions for my security
had been adjusted, there was nothing now to hinder me from
commencing my real journey. Never before had the Egyptian
Government done so much indirectly to co-operate with a
scientific traveller; and it was with no little satisfaction that
I regarded my budget of documents, which would unlock for
me so considerable a section of Central Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">EMBARKATION ON THE WHITE NILE.</div>

<p>In order to have continually about me a number of people
upon whose fidelity and attachment I might fairly rely under
all circumstances, I took into my service six Nubians, who
had settled in Khartoom with their wives and children, and
who resided there, and had already travelled in different
parts of the Upper Nile. All had previously served under
other Europeans. Riharn, the cook, had accompanied the
Consul Petherick on his ill-fated journey of 1863. Their
conduct in no way disappointed me, and I had never any
serious cause of complaint against any of them.</p>

<p>At last, all preparations had so far prospered that the
journey to the Gazelle River might be commenced on the
5th of January 1869. A little concession had, however, to
be made to the superstitious representations of the Khartoom
people. Wednesday and Saturday, as days of ill-omen, were
excluded from the times of departure. Somehow or other
this introduced a parley which entailed a little delay. Protestations,
I knew, availed but little, and my common sense
suggested unconditional submission to the custom of the
country. Not simply was it impossible to convince the
people of the absurdity of any superstition of theirs, but what
was of more moment, they would be sure, on the very first
occasion of any mischance, to attribute it to the perverseness
of the Frank. They would have looked idly and helplessly
on if I had persisted in carrying out my will in opposition to
the decrees of fate.</p>

<p>On board our little vessel we altogether counted thirty-two,
a number small in comparison with that in the other
boats. The total number, however, did not admit of much
reduction. No boat’s crew alone could suffice to overcome
the obstacles which were to be expected in the waters
further up the country.</p>

<p>The merchant Ghattas, to whom the boat belonged, had
manned it with eight boatmen, and had also put on board
fifteen hired men to serve, partly as a protection against any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
attacks, and partly to assist in towing the boats. The
soldiers, as they were called, were for the most part young,
and were originally inhabitants of the valley of the Upper
Nile, between Berber and Khartoom, but from whence they
had been driven to escape on account of the heavy taxation.
Since agriculture hardly kept them from misery and starvation,
they preferred to hire themselves out as robbers, slave-hunters,
cattle-stealers, or whatever could enable them to
gratify the innate propensity for adventure which belongs
to every Nubian. Besides the six Nubians engaged in
Khartoom, my own retinue included two women slaves, whose
hand labour supplied the want of mills; their office, performed
by means of stones, was to convert our corn into the
flour requisite for the maintenance of the crew. We were
packed closely enough; cramped up, we appeared like cattle
in a <a id="chg2"></a>pew, yet our accommodation was comparatively spacious.
Other boats I saw of which the dimensions were hardly
larger than our own, and which were made to carry sometimes
sixty, sometimes eighty human beings. But even this
was a trifling repletion as compared with the boats we met,
and which, in a hold of not more than fifty tons, often stowed
away 200 slaves. The crew squat like hens on shelves outstretched
upon deck between mast and mast; and in order
to afford the soldiers rest by night, the vessels lie-to whenever
the shore is safe.</p>

<p>A rough wooden partition erected at the stern of the bulky
vessel was assigned to me as my special berth. I had arranged
it as well as I could, and sat there surrounded, in charming
confusion, by baggage and trunks, and the thousand articles
which made up my equipment. The boats which are used
upon the upper waters of the Nile are called “negger;”
their construction, I believe, is unlike what can be seen in
any other country of the world. They are as strong as they
are massive, being built so as to withstand the violent pushings
of the hippopotamuses, as well as the collisions with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the mussel banks, which are scattered in various directions.
I am certain that one of these boats at any maritime exhibition
would attract the attention of all who take any interest
in such things. I am not aware that there is anything
accurate to be found in any history of travel on this subject,
and it may be permitted me therefore to insert a few particulars
of the Khartoom ship-building.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHIP-BUILDING AT KHARTOOM.</div>

<p>There can be no question that the ship-building on the
Red Sea, just like the architecture of the towns along its
coast, is of Indian origin, all the timber required in Arabia
being procured from India. At Khartoom, on the contrary,
this art, although in many respects it has peculiarities of its
own, has been derived from an Egyptian source. Taking
their own special requirements into account, the boat-builders
of Egypt have completely altered the structure and shape of
their river boats. It must be borne in mind that the recurring
cataracts, which interrupt the navigation of the Nubian
Nile valley, rendered any ascent of the river a matter of
difficulty, demanding indeed the most strenuous exertions.
The cataracts are ten in number, and only recently have
they been overcome by some small steam vessels of about
60-horse power. The only wood which is used in Khartoom
for ship-building is that of the Sunt acacia (<i lang="la">A. nilotica</i>),
which, though far heavier and harder than our oak, is the
only wood which the soil of the Soudan supplies, which
appears capable of being sawn into planks. But on account
of the irregular texture and numerous branches of the trunk
of this acacia, it is impossible to cut it into boards more than
ten feet in length, and even these are rare. Masts and
sail-yards, since those of deal seldom reach Khartoom, and
then are of an exorbitant price, must be made by splicing
together a number of small pieces. Externally these are
bound with ox hide; but in violent gales they are extremely
liable to start. Not only does the wood fail to be either
straight or long, it is also so hard, that it requires to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
sawn while it is green. The saw is an instrument so rarely
employed throughout Nubia, that it is handled most unskilfully
by the carpenters; as matter of course, there are
neither steam-mills nor water-mills in Khartoom, and consequently
the planks are cut without the faintest pretence
to regularity.</p>

<p>All these defects are, however, cancelled by the unexampled
toughness and indestructible nature of the wood;
it might fairly be asked from what other material could
boats 60 feet long and 20 feet broad be constructed without
ribs or braces. The sides of the boat are a foot
thick, and are formed of layers of different lengths, which
acquire stability and firmness from their own support. An
empty boat, seen from inside, has somewhat the appearance
of an elongated shell of half a hazel-nut. The planks, where
they overlap or are dove-tailed together, are fastened by iron
nails driven in perpendicularly, the necessary holes being
bored from the outer to the inner surfaces in such a way
that the same nail holds together two, or occasionally more,
thicknesses of wood. In this manner, with much trouble
and more measuring, is obtained the proper curvature of the
hull, which, as a whole, is marked by a complete symmetry.
The cost of the stout iron nails, and the rapid wear of axe
and saw, make the expenses of building these boats so considerable
that they amount to five times as much as oak
vessels of the same size in Europe. A mast about 20 feet
high bears the giant-yard of the single lateen sail, which is
generally half as long again as the boat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIGHT ON THE RIVER.</div>

<p>Amid the farewell salutations of a large concourse, among
which my people counted numerous friends and relations,
we pushed off from the shore. Without delay we took our
onward course to the mouth of the Blue Nile, doubling the
Ras-el-Khartoom, that large promontory, which resembles in
form the snout of an animal; it gives its name to the town,
and is the partition land between the two arms of the Nile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Bulky and ponderous as was our boat, the power of the
north wind laid its hold upon our giant-sail, and carried us
with the speed of steam towards the south. On the forenoon
of the following day we found ourselves already 1°
below the latitude of Khartoom. We sailed, without staying
our course, through the night, which was cheered by the
moonlight. I was sleepless with excitement at finding myself
at last brought irrevocably to the attainment of my
cherished hopes. The universal quiet was only broken by
the rush of the bilge-water, and now and then by the cry
of the water-birds. Shrouded like mummies in their white
garments lay the crew, closely packed upon the narrow
deck; and altogether there was something spectral in the
stillness of the nocturnal voyage.</p>

<p>As the morning sun fell upon the low monotonous shores
of the flowing river, it seemed at times almost as though it
were illuminating the ocean, so vast was the extent of water
where the current ran for any distance in a straight and
unwinding course. Low levels, that seemed interminable,
only marked out from the land beyond by narrow belts of
trees, formed the framework of the scene. The borders of
the desert rise and fall in gentle undulations, on which stand,
sometimes scantily and sometimes thickly, groups of Haras
and Seyal acacias. The vegetation which is visible demonstrates
the complete desert character of Nubia. The shooshgrass
(<i lang="la">Panicum turgidum</i>), the most general of herbage for
the camels, is here trodden down in masses.</p>

<p>The voyage up the White Nile has been very frequently
described by various travellers. The districts along the
shore mostly retain an unchanging aspect for miles together.
Barely does some distant mountain or isolated hill relieve
the eye from the wide monotony. In spite of all, there was
no lack of interest. There is much that cannot fail to make
the progress ever striking and impressive.</p>

<p>The attention is soon attracted by the astonishing number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
of geese and ducks which are seen day after day. The
traveller in these parts is so satiated with them, fattened and
roasted, that the sight creates something akin to disgust.
The number of cattle is prodigious: far as the eye can reach
they are scattered alike on either shore, whilst, close at
hand, they come down to the river-marshes to get their
drink. The stream, as wide again as the Nile of Egypt, is
enlivened by the boats belonging to the shepherds, who row
hither and thither to conduct their cattle, their dogs in the
water swimming patiently behind.</p>

<p>Early on the third day we reached Getina, a considerable
village inhabited by Hassanieh, and which is a favourite
rendezvous of the Nile-boats. The flats here were bright
with the luxuriant green of the sedge; growing abundantly
as it does, it serves to impart to the banks the meadow-like
character of northern tracts. Thousands of geese (<i lang="la">Chenalopex
ægyptiacus</i>), in no degree disconcerted by the arrival of
any stranger, waddled up and down. Although in places the
right bank is bounded by sand-banks thirty feet high, the
left appears completely and interminably flat, and occasionally
admits of the culture of sorghum. This remarkable
difference which exists between the aspect of the two banks,
and which may be observed for several degrees, is to be
explained by a hydrographical law, which is illustrated not
only here, but likewise in the district of the Lower Nile.
As rivers flow from southerly into more northern latitudes,
their fluid particles are set in motion with increased velocity,
the result of which is to drive them onwards so as to wash
away the eastern bank, leaving a continual deposit on the
west.</p>

<p>This phenomenon, which may be just as plainly perceived
on several of the great rivers of Europe, is, as might be
expected, presented here on a large scale, where the Nile
retains its northerly direction along a course which extends
over a third part of the earth’s quadrant. Hence it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
arisen that the cultivated fields lie more generally upon the
western shore, while the eastern gives a deeper fairway, and
is found dotted at intervals with settled villages. Hardly
ever does the fairway deviate from the eastern shore, and the
evident depression of the shore has led several travellers to
suspect that they have discovered a proof of the continuous
sloping of the land, which, in truth, is only apparent.</p>

<p>It will be understood, therefore, how great a mistake is
made in attempting to estimate, as many of my predecessors
have done, the degree of productiveness of the country by
the sandy levels and starving fields on the right bank. As
matter of fact, the White Nile is enriched by an alluvium
which would be quite as fruitful as that of the Blue Nile,
except that it is wanting in the crumbling clay, which is the
product of the volcanic mountains of Abyssinia, and which
undoubtedly exercises a most beneficial influence on the
results of Egyptian agriculture. Here the soil is not only
rich, it is remarkable for its lightness; and, probably from
the absence of chalk, it has a warmer, brighter colour than
generally marks the Nubian or Egyptian land.</p>

<p>Towards midday the wind had so much increased that our
Reis let the boat drift without sail against the stream. The
progress we thus made was surprising: then as the gale
gradually fell, we ventured to unfurl our sail, till the speed
we reached was like that of an arrow over the waters. We
drove through the midst of the flocks of geese which came
athwart our course, and firing at random caught up as many
of the wounded as came within our grasp. Towards the
close of the day we reached Wod-Shellay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOD-SHELLAY.</div>

<p>Wod-Shellay is one of the favourite resting-places of all
voyagers upon the Nile. Here, according to custom, an ox
was slaughtered,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and a formal leave was taken of the
Mohammedan world, by liberal draughts of merissa beer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
This leave-taking had to be repeated more than once. We
were told that higher up the stream there were no more
villages, but somehow or other opportunities were found,
either on pretext of making purchases or of looking at old
friends, on which it became necessary to have some more
parting cups of merissa beer. Subject to these delays, I lost
considerable time frequently in insipid dreariness, where
neither scenes nor men could excite my interest.</p>

<p>After making a complete day of rest at Wod-Shellay, I
crossed over to the western shore on a brief excursion. I
entered some villages at a distance from the Nile and gained
some information as to the condition of their agriculture.
Wide, though much thinned, forests of the Sunt acacia (<i lang="la">A.
nilotica</i> and <i lang="la">arabica</i>) cover the districts near the shore;
further on there was a wide extent of cultivated flat. The
soil is a stiffish ash-grey clay, different from that of Egypt,
but not inferior in fertility—&#8203;an opinion which Sir Samuel
Baker, not investigating the west and being acquainted
only with the sandy east, has ventured to deny.</p>

<p>A large yellow-grained variety of <i lang="la">Sorghum vulgare</i>, known
in the Khartoom markets as “soffra,” thrives here in such
perfection that but few ears came under my notice which
were not at least nine inches long and more than four in
diameter; convincing evidence to me of the fruitful nature
of the ground.</p>

<p>I was accompanied by Arslan, a great sheep-dog, which I
had brought with me from Europe, and in all the villages
through which I passed the inhabitants, as I advanced,
scampered off in terror, crying “Hyæna, hyæna!” It was
difficult to make them understand that the brown-spotted
animal was only a dog. I do not think I know a country
where the dread of great dogs is so universal as in the Soudan.</p>

<p>But a few years ago unlimited forests here met the
stranger’s eye; the large demand for timber for ship-building
purposes, however, has all but destroyed them. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Wod-Shellay, in Mohammed Ali’s time, the Government
maintained a large dock, on which were built the numerous
boats which that enterprising ruler sent out into the upper
districts; at present there is a similar establishment higher
up the stream upon the Isle of Aba, where the stores of wood
are awhile secured to meet the demands of the future.
Scarcely one tree out of a hundred yields timber suitable for
building: and all along the bank the owners like to pay their
taxes by means of wood instead of money; the consequence
naturally is that the best trees are prematurely lost and that
old trees are comparatively rare. The steamboat service on
these waters is much assisted by the inexhaustible supply of
fuel which is everywhere to be procured along the banks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNT ARRASH-KOL.</div>

<p>Our voyage was next continued, through the night, as far
as a watering-place on the western shore, near which lay the
village of Turra. We lay-to in sight of the neighbouring
mountain Arrash-kol.</p>

<p>The hippopotamuses now became more frequent; their
noise, gurgling, and snorting was heard far over the waters,
and grated as harshly on the ear as the incessant creaking of
our own rudder. The traveller up the White Nile must
accustom himself to this, or he has no hope of an undisturbed
night’s rest.</p>

<p>The western shores, which are marked by rows of acacias
almost as though arranged in avenues, have nothing African
in their aspect, chiefly on account of the absence of the
palm, that chief ornament of the tropics; they rather
remind of what may be seen in the thinly-populated districts
beside the Volga and other of the streams of Russia. The
Arrash-kol is an isolated mountain some hundred feet high,
of which the jagged steeps jut up from the uniform level.
It is well known to botanists through the treasures which
were gathered there thirty years ago by the traveller
Kotschy. Time did not permit me to investigate the country
from this interesting centre. I was obliged to content<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
myself with a trip to the village of Turra, two leagues
away.</p>

<p>No idea can be formed of the number of cattle all hereabouts;
the route leads over continual watering-places,
where herds of cattle, varying in number from 1000 to 3000,
are assembled, and form a most striking spectacle. The
cattle of the Hassanieh are distinguished by a hump, and are
of a race peculiar to the whole of the Soudan, having beyond
a doubt some close affinity to the Indian zebu. The ox of
the Egyptians, which, in consequence of the cattle-plague in
1863-64, has almost entirely died out, has no hump. Its
horns are short, and it differs in the shape of its skull
from the ox of the Soudan; the breed has survived only in
Central Nubia. In girth and height, not only do the cattle
of the Hassanieh exceed the Egyptian, but those which I
shall have occasion to mention hereafter as belonging to the
Baggara Arabs, surpass the breeds which are kept by the
pagan negroes of the Upper Nile. Amongst the Shillooks
and Dinka, for instance, the light grey colour predominates,
whilst the marking of the skin in the majority of those of
which we speak is like a spotted leopard, black specks on a
lightish ground; but neither are the white and brown, the
piebald, nor coats entirely dun-colour, at all unfrequent.</p>

<p>I was conducted through the fragrant wood of the flowering
acacia to a place where a little weekly market had
gathered the neatherds of the neighbourhood, and where
milk flowed in streams. The Hassanieh do not differ externally
from the score of other nomad races which, more or
less Arabised, inhabit the steppes and deserts on both sides
of the Nile. They appeared to me far more confiding than
my old friends the Bishareen and Hadendoa, but perhaps
for the reason that, speaking good Arabic, they were able to
contribute their part to a good understanding on both sides.
They crowded round me everywhere to gaze at my strange
big dog, and I was repeatedly obliged to give a history in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
detail of his genealogy, his qualities, and all about him.
Being in possession of a splendid race of greyhounds, which
they train for gazelle hunting, and of which they have a
high opinion, their interest was raised to the highest pitch.
The dogs smelt strongly; and it is no exaggeration to say,
so did the men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFRICAN NOVELTIES.</div>

<p>The graceful shade acacias (<i lang="la">A. spirocarpa</i>) here come once
again into the front, soon to be finally lost sight of on the
other side of the neighbouring desert. Along the right
bank there were many masses of a large-leaved shrub, which
covers the country, and for miles disputes the precedence
with all the prevailing vegetation; it is the <i lang="la">Ipomæa asarifolia</i>,
appearing in some places like rose bushes in the luxuriant
adornment of its ample blossoms, a bright relief to the
general dreariness of the shore.</p>

<p>Our voyage is again continued by night; the channel is
broad and deep; freely we sail throughout the hours of
darkness. The noise of the hippopotamuses is the chief disturbance;
it seems as if there is no relief from their tumult.
It almost seemed as if they were quite close about us, but
one had but to look around, and their clumsy heads were
visible in the distance, projecting like black points above
the stream. By way of variety there came, at intervals, the
roar of some lion prowling on the bank. Such were the
novelties of Africa.</p>

<p>In the morning we passed Dueme, one of the largest
villages in this district. Soon we reached the groups of
little islands whose soil, naturally fertile, has been successfully
subject to a recent cultivation. It is a cheering sign
of the progress of cultivation in these regions, to see the
fellaheen of Nubia travelling continually further and further
up the banks of the White Nile. The passive population of
blacks on the river, at least in the space of a few decades,
has been partly displaced, and partly spurred on to greater
energy; and doubtless, therefore, there are many places in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Nubia itself capable of being cultivated, which have become
desolate only as a consequence of the oppressiveness of a
heavy taxation.</p>

<p>The flocks of geese were still unending, and every expedient
was resorted to to make a variety in the way of cooking
them; they were stuffed with rice; they were dressed
with tomato sauce; they were served with mushrooms; and
when every imaginable way of preparing them was exhausted,
we had recourse, by way of variety, to the ducks (<i lang="la">Anas
viduata</i>) which were obtainable. Then was the golden age
of my <i lang="fr">cuisine</i>. Our provisions were ample, and the inventive
faculties of my cook Riharn turned them all to the best
account. But different times were yet to come, times when
Riharn must murmur that the three years of his life spent in
Shepherd’s Hotel in Cairo had all been sacrificed, and must
repine that he could find no scope for his abilities in Central
Africa. The result of all this was, that he was a terrible
backslider in his art, and at the end of three years could
never cook a dish of rice without burning it.</p>

<p>A few days after our departure I had made the unpleasant
discovery that the prudent Ghattas, to whom the vessel
belonged, with an eye to economy, had put on board, without
due protection, all his powder and a year’s supply of
the cartridges necessary for the expedition. In order to
save the expense of proper chests he had wrapped up several
hundredweight of these combustibles loosely in sacks of matting
and paper parcels only, and piled them up just under
the entrance to my cabin, where I was accustomed to sit
smoking my pipe and surveying the land. I had now thrown
a cowhide across this explosive heap, and so secured that
the smoking and the contemplation might be resumed with
greater composure on my part.</p>

<p>On the same day we reached the Egyptian military station
Kowa, or El-Ais, at which there is a large Government corn-store.
El-Ais was for years the extreme southern boundary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of the State. Passing through it is a much frequented road,
which crosses the White as well as the Blue Nile, and unites
Kordofan with Abyssinia. Along this road the Baggara
fetch most of their horses, which they buy by auction in the
market of Gallabat.</p>

<p>Directly above Kowa begins the region of the Shillook
Islands, which, as yet unthinned by the axe, are very valuable.
A little further up the stream, following the outline
of the banks, stretches a series of Nubian agricultural settlement.
At one of these goodly islands, known as Om-mandeb,
we stayed our course awhile. Mandeb is the name here
given to the prickliest of prickly plants, the <i lang="la">Mimosa asperata</i>;
transplanted by the stream, it is occasionally found even as
far off as Egypt, but here it surrounds the island shore, and
forms a hedge of impenetrable thorns. Here in a wild state
is the water melon, and I have submitted proofs that the
cradle of this nursling of culture lies in Africa, the original
home of the domestic cat and of the ass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE.</div>

<p>A rich variety of animal life is developed in this wilderness;
not only did the shore swarm with hippopotamuses,
whose vestiges were like deep pit-holes, but the ground was
scooped out in places vacated by rows of crocodiles, which
now basked only thirty paces in our front. Great iguanas
(<i lang="la">Varanus</i>) and snakes rustled in the dry grass. Everywhere
under the trees were snake skins and egg shells; above in
the branches was heard the commotion of the mischievous
monkeys (<i lang="la">Cercopithecus griseoviridus</i>), whilst birds of many
a species, eagles from giant nests, and hosts of fluttering
water-fowl, gave incessant animation to the scenery of the
shore.</p>

<p>What, however, most interested me, was the unlimited
variety in the kinds of water plants which abounded on the
floods, the sport of the winds and waves. Among them the
Herminiera, known under the native name of ambatch, has
already been the subject of general remark; it plays so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
prominent a part in the upper waters of the Nile, that it
might fairly be designated the most remarkable of the native
plants.</p>

<p>My predecessor, Kotschy, who did not know that it had
already been observed by Adanson in Senegambia, named it
<i lang="la">Ædemone mirabilis</i>, which was corrupted into the still more
wonderful name of <i lang="la">Anemone mirabilis</i>, and so appeared in
many books which treated of Africa. The ambatch is distinguished
for the unexampled lightness of its wood, if the
fungus-like substance of the stem deserves such a name at
all. It shoots up to 15 or 20 feet in height, and at its base
generally attains a thickness of about 6 inches. The weight
of this fungus-wood is so insignificant that it really suggests
comparison to a feather. Only by taking it into his hands
could any one believe that it were possible for one man to
lift on to his shoulders a raft made large enough to carry
eight people on the water. The plant shoots up with great
rapidity by the quiet places of the shore, and since it roots
merely in the water, whole bushes are easily broken off by
the force of the wind or stream, and settle themselves afresh
in other places: This is the true origin of the grass-barriers
so frequently mentioned as blocking up the waters of the
Upper Nile, and in many seasons making navigation utterly
impracticable. Other plants have a share in the formation
of these floating islands, which daily emerge like the Delos
of tradition; among them, in particular, the vossia grass,
and the famous papyrus of antiquity, which at present is
nowhere to be found either in Nubia or in Egypt.</p>

<p>On the 13th of January, on one of the thronging islands,
we had our first <i lang="fr">rencontre</i> with the Shillooks. This tribe of
negroes formerly extended themselves much further north
than at present, having settlements on all the islands; but
now they only exceptionally penetrate to this latitude
(12° 30´) in their canoes of hollow tamarind stems. The
Baggara, meanwhile, are ever gaining a firmer footing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the river banks, and have already with their flocks ventured
far to the east of the stream into the land of the Dinka.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISFORTUNE.</div>

<p>Some long islands of sand distinguished by stripes here
gave a noticeable feature to the scene; they were cohered
with flocks of Balearic or peacock cranes, which had arranged
themselves in five or six rows like a regiment of soldiers,
their beaks turned to the wind and facing the north. When
young this bird, thus plentifully supplied, has flesh more
palatable than the goose, because it feeds on corn and
beans; and, like the guinea fowl, it made a change in our
bill of fare. On the western banks were large herds of antelopes
(<i lang="la">A. megaloceras</i>), which we could see peacefully coming
down to drink. In other places we passed close by trees
with a lively population of monkeys swinging on the
branches; and now for the first time we observed the troops
of maraboo storks, which made their appearance in considerable
numbers by the water’s edge. All this diversity of life
gave the fascination of romance to the loneliness of the
forest.</p>

<p>The 14th of January was the first day of ill-luck, which I
was myself the means of bringing about. Early in the morning
another boat had joined us; and the people wished me
to allow them to stay awhile that they might enjoy themselves
together. Being, however, at a spot which seemed to
me extremely dull, I urged them to go further, in order to
land on a little island that appeared more full of interest.
The excursion which I took was attended by a misfortune
which befell one of the two men whom I took to accompany
me. Mohammed Amin, such was his name, running at my
side, had chanced to come upon a wild buffalo, that I had
not the least intention of injuring, but which the man, unhappily,
approached too near in the high grass. The buffalo,
it would seem, was taking his midday nap, and disturbed
from his siesta, rose in the utmost fury. To spring up and
whirl the destroyer of his peace in the air was but the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
of an instant. There lay my faithful companion, bleeding
all over, and in front of him, tail erect, stood the buffalo
roaring, and in a threatening attitude ready to trample
down his victim. As fate would have it, however, the attention
of the infuriated brute was attracted by the other two
men, who stood by looking on speechless with astonishment.
I had no gun; Mohammed had been carrying my breech-loader
in his hand, and there it was swinging on the left
horn of the buffalo. The other man with me, who carried
my rifle, had immediately taken aim, but the trigger snapped
in vain, and time after time the gun missed fire. No time
now for any consultation; it was a question of a moment.
The man grasped at a small iron hatchet and hurled it
straight at the buffalo’s head from a distance of about
twenty paces; the aim was good, and thus was the prey
rescued from the enemy. With a wild bound the buffalo
threw itself sidelong into the reeds, tore along through the
rustling stalks with its ponderous weight, bellowing and
shaking all the ground. Roaring and growling, bounding
violently from side to side, he could be seen in wild career,
and as we presumed that the whole herd might be in his
train, we seized the guns, and made our quickest way to a
neighbouring tree. All, however, soon was quiet, and our
next thought was directed to the unfortunate sufferer.
Mohammed’s head lay as though nailed to the ground, his
ears pierced by sharp reed-stalks, but a moment’s inspection
convinced us that the injuries were not fatal. The buffalo’s
horn had struck his mouth, and, besides the loss of four teeth
in the upper jaw and some minor fractures, he had sustained
no further harm. I left my other companion on the spot to
wash Mohammed, and hastened alone to the distant boat to
have him fetched. In three weeks he had recovered, and as
an equivalent for each of his four teeth he had a backsheesh
of ten dollars. This liberality on my part wonderfully
animated the desire for enterprise amongst my companions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
and put them in great good humour towards me for the
future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRETHREN IN THE FAITH.</div>

<p>After a long time a mountain once again appeared; it
was the two peaks of the Nyemati, imposing masses of
granite which rise aloft on the right. We took up our
quarters on the opposite island, where a number of Baggara
Arabs had pitched their tented camp. “Habbabkum, habbabkum,
habbabkum, aschera” (good friends), again and
again our people begin to shout as soon as they see their
swarthy brethren in the faith upon the shore. Then from
our side are heard demands for “semmem” and for “roab”
(butter and buttermilk), whilst the Arabs cry for “esh, esh,”
that is, for corn. “Corn,” we reply, “we have hardly
enough for ourselves.” And then once more ensues the
mingling of the sounds “semmem” and “habbabkum.” At
last, on shore, we are embracing the “habbabkums” with
wonderful emotion; but this does not quite go down; we
find everything they offer us has to be paid for handsomely
at Khartoom market-prices. As soon as it was seen that
nothing was to be got out of them without payment, our
crew was not long in conferring upon them the name of
“Nas-batalin” (rascals).</p>

<p>The women were much more courteous, and vied in
amiability, so as to entice as many visitors as possible to
their merissa-shops. These they had improvised in their
huts, eager to make a profit from the ever-thirsty Khartoomers
as they sail along. With these women, who were
ever actively employed at the hearth, though little accustomed
to keep alive the sacred fire of Vesta, my party spent their
holiday in rioting and revelry. I, for my part, lingered out
my time on the neighbouring steppe, treating the children
to biscuits, as I should to bonbons.</p>

<p>The Baggara Arabs possess the wide district which extends
from Kordofan and Darfur on the south, as far as the river
banks inhabited by the Dinka and Shillooks. Part of them—&#8203;indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
in the east, a third of them—&#8203;pay tribute to Egypt.
The name Baggara means “neatherds,” and indeed their
wealth consists simply of cattle; they are not, however,
shepherds, as they are represented in the idylls of home, but
mounted and warlike from their youth; they are bolder
robbers than any other of the Ethiopian nomad races. They
bring down elephants with lance and sword, a feat scarcely
less free from risk than playing with lions and leopards as
though they were kittens. Many of them hire themselves
out to the Khartoomers to accompany their expeditions to the
interior. Several came to offer their services to me, under
the impression that my object was the capture of slaves. I
confess that I could hardly restrain my admiration when I
gazed upon their athlete, agile forms, although I had no call
for their services.</p>

<p>The Baggara speak a tolerably pure Soudan-Arabic; they
seem to extend themselves rapidly as an immigrant tribe
over the pasture steppes, at the expense of other and less
favoured races. Their countenances betray little of the
Semitic expression, and I saw not a few whose physiognomy
reminded me of some of my old friends at home. I can
confidently maintain that they form the finest race of the
nomad people dwelling on the Nile. I could not help being
surprised at the love of ornament and finery which was
manifested by this race, advanced as it is. The clothing of
the generality consists of indigo-blue shirts, such as are worn
by the peasants of Egypt, whilst the more wealthy array
themselves in robes of scarlet and figured calico.</p>

<p>On the other shore I visited the mountain, which is almost
contiguous to the river. Growing here I first found the
tamarind, which never failed me more throughout my entire
wanderings. The thick shade of these bright green trees
makes them a favourite rendezvous on all the roads of
Central Africa. Every traveller in the Soudan can scarce be
otherwise than quite familiar with the Hegelig (<i lang="la">Balanites</i>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
of which, like plums, the fruit falls off and thickly strews
the ground below. By the people of Khartoom it is called
Lalôb. It contains a sweetish pulp, tasting at first like
gingerbread, but it leaves a bitter taste behind, and is purgative
in its properties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNT NYEMATI.</div>

<p>Climbing about 800 feet I reached the summit of the
Nyemati, and had a fine view of the steppes intersected by
the stream. The slopes consist partly of rough, massy
blocks of granite, and partly of huge unbroken flats, some
a hundred feet in length, which descend to the river and in
places appear like sunken roofs. In the rifts and deeper
clefts swarm multitudes of bats, and a fetid atmosphere
exhales from these murky chasms. The Abyssinian rock-rabbit,
creeping like a marmot over the stones, is ever to
be seen among the mountains of the steppes. The eastern
horizon is bounded by the mountains of the Dar-el-Fungi
in Upper Sennaar, at a distance of more than thirty miles.</p>

<p>As we progressed further the river islands became more
frequent, and the channels more and more narrowed by the
surrounding masses of impenetrable grass. The ambatch is
here almost excluded by the vossia grass, but only to re-appear
at the mouth of the waters. We came continually
upon Baggara, with whom, without stopping on our course,
we talked and discussed the market prices of provisions. A
fine fat bullock was bought for only three dollars, a price at
which it would pay to found here a company for the extract
of meat; the skins are not exported, but are used in the
country. The Baggara hold all the left bank, and visit it
in winter when the steppes in the interior are dry and
scorched. Wherever they settle, as now and then they do,
either on the islands or on the right bank, they completely
drive out the Shillook negroes. At various times in the day
we landed to fraternise with the Baggara. The large flocks
of ducks afforded entertaining and successful sport; and as
for geese, there were still more than I and my people could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
eat. To and fro, ever and again swept through the water a
Shillook fishing in his fragile boat; he is not entitled to the
“habbabkum,” because he is a heathen; he is mocked with
“Wod-e-Mek” (son of a king) for a greeting, made to tell
where he comes from, and whither he is going, and if he has
any fish, it is taken from him: such is the practice on every
vessel. But the Shillooks are also subject to Egyptian rule,
and there is no reason to doubt that in a short time they will
enjoy equal rights with the other subjects of the Viceroy,
however insignificant these may appear to be.</p>

<p>To a degree that created some misgiving as to what might
be before us, the progress now began to be unalterably
tedious. For a weary time all woodlands seemed wholly to
have forsaken the shore; nothing was to be perceived but
the desolation of a vast savannah. Dark brown widow-ducks
(<i lang="la">Anas viduata</i>) and shovellers were shot, whose oily taste is
only disguised by red pepper. At night the time was usually
beguiled by stories of adventures in the Upper Nile district.
Everyone has something wonderful which he delights to tell,
something beyond all experience, and is ready to swear by
the Koran and by the beard of the Prophet that what he says
is true. “Africa,” said Aristotle ages ago, “has always
something new to show;” the latest tale was now about the
pygmies, of whom I here received my earliest information.
I had no idea that I should be brought into actual and close
connection with such people. I laughed at the accounts
which eye-witnesses gave of them, and, for my part, quietly
put them into the category of men with tails. I took my
share in dressing up a story for the entertainment of my
party. Alexandre Dumas’s tale, ‘l’Homme à queue,’ served
my purpose admirably. It is so clever, and yet so pointed in
its fine simplicity, that it thoroughly enlisted the attention
of all who heard it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NILE VEGETATION.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the undeniable sameness which prevailed
in its outward character, I found every fresh landing-place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
afford me some surprise or other. Rich was the reward of
penetrating, as I did, a thorough wilderness on the right
bank on the mainland. Buffaloes forcing their way along
had beaten many avenues through thickets and creepers,
and along these I went, followed by a group of armed men.
The vestiges in every direction were so conclusive as to the
number of the beasts that were about, that we might well
expect a <i lang="fr">rencontre</i> as dangerous as that which has already
been related. Here in a wild state is found the Luffa, a plant
of the gourd family. The dried fruit of this contains a
fibrous skeleton, that answers the purpose of a bathing-sponge,
and it is frequently cultivated in Egypt for that
purpose. I could enumerate a whole series of plants, known
in Egypt only under cultivation, which find their original
and proper home in the primeval forests of the White Nile.
Not unreasonably may an inference be drawn that, in ages
indefinitely long ago, the entire Nile Valley exhibited a
vegetation harmonising in its character throughout, much
more than now. It was the upgrowth of civilisation in
ancient Egypt which displaced the flora from its northern
seat, and made it, as at present, only to be found hundreds
of miles higher up the land. This assumption is in a measure
confirmed by the traditions which survive with regard to
animals. In remote times, the ibis, the hippopotamus, the
crocodile, all existed in far more northerly latitudes than
now. The papyrus, it may be added, gives its witness to the
same theory.</p>

<p>After a while the southern horizon was again broken by
the elevation of a mountain, which proved to be the Defafang,
an extinct volcano, 1000 feet high, several miles from
the river. Werne, one of the first explorers of the Upper
Nile waters, the only European who visited this locality,
collected a variety of specimens of the rocks, and they
exhibited the volcanic nature of the basaltic lava, corresponding
to similar formations in the Eifel. This mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
stands as the boundary-mark between the first negro territory
on the White Nile and the shepherd race of the Baggara.</p>

<p>As we were sailing in deep water close to the reedy shore,
the roar and rustle of our great sail started up a herd of wild
buffaloes, which disappeared from sight, before we had time
to seize our rifles. When presently we were passing the last
camp of the Baggara, our attention was attracted to a scene
of excitement, at once vivid and picturesque. The entire
population, alarmed by an attack of wild buffaloes on some
cattle-drivers, was up and in hot pursuit. Hundreds of men
armed with lance or sword, some of them mounted, were
furiously hurrying to the scene, urged on by the frantic
shrieks of the excited women. We could not resist the conclusion
that the buffaloes, which we had disturbed, had
proceeded to attack the neighbouring drivers. An impression
seemed to prevail that we had fired at the Baggara, but
in the tumult nobody exactly understood the circumstances.
The gale was in our favour, and we glided rapidly out of
reach without learning the precise issue of the disorder. We
observed one poor fellow who had incurred a disaster similar
to, and perhaps worse than, that which happened to my own
Mohammed Amin. About Mohammed I may here mention
that his upper lip had been held together by a couple of
insect-needles; that he had been treated to plenty of pap
and camomile-tea, and that after spitting out one little
splinter of bone after another, he soon found himself getting
all right again.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon the boat sailed for a wager
with a flotilla of light-grey pelicans. Repeated small shot
could not make them rise; but at last we outstripped them,
and succeeded in shooting down several from the group.
From the supple breast-feathers of this bird, the savages of
the Upper Nile prepare close perukes, which make an excellent
imitation of a luxuriant crop of grey hair, and would be
a valuable acquisition to any theatrical wardrobe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MOHAMMED KHER.</div>

<p>A hurried trip upon the left bank brought me upon the
track of a large herd of elephants. According to the Baggara,
this district is most prolific as a hunting-ground for
these animals. The adjacent territories of the Shillooks, on
the other hand, are too densely populated to allow elephants
to be numerous, and they have to be sought at some distance,
where on account of the wide water-level, they are often
reached in boats.</p>

<p>At sunset we reached a place on the right bank, which will
always retain a certain notoriety in the history of the White
Nile, as having once been the headquarters of the renowned
robber chief, Mohammed Kher. The raised works, having
on their interior traces of decayed walls of earth, and surrounded
by deep trenches, mark the site of Mohammed
Kher’s seriba. To judge by the heaps of bones which still
exist, the number of cattle slaughtered and feasted on must
have been something enormous. Booty was plundered from
far and near, but the Shillooks were the greatest sufferers.
Mohammed Kher, with his contingent of well-mounted
Baggara, was not only for many years a terror to the neighbouring
negro races, but could defy the authority of the
Governor at Khartoom. Yet principally it was he who
taught the people of Khartoom how, by means of earthworks
and regular ramparts, to intimidate the natives and bring
them into subjection. Many human bones, the relics of
slaves carried off by sickness, as well as the skulls of asses
and horses, are found everywhere about. As a consequence
of the burning of the steppes, they are frequently noticed in
a half-charred condition. Throughout Africa burnt human
bones are ever the marks which the slave trade leaves behind.
Not far from this ill-famed place we lay-to alongside the
village of Kaka, the most northerly place inhabited by Shillooks
on the White Nile, and at which the Egyptian Government
maintained a depôt for corn. Twenty years ago
hundreds of Dinka villages stood on this side of the river.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
From the descriptions of travellers who accompanied the
expeditions sent out by Mehemet Ali to discover the sources
of the Nile, it has been ascertained that the number of the
population here was formerly as important as it now is in
the very heart of the Shillook country. As a result of the
incessant ravages of Mohammed Kher, the entire eastern
shore has degenerated into a forest waste. The river still parts
the separate districts of the hostile tribes; but the Shillooks
have attempted to settle nowhere except at Kaka in the
deserted district; the Dinka, on their part, having withdrawn
some days’ journey into the interior.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the boat, a great crowd of naked
Shillooks, prompted by curiosity, assembled on the shore, my
dog still being the chief attraction. The first sight of a
throng of savages, suddenly presenting themselves in their
native nudity, is one from which no amount of familiarity
can remove the strange impression; it takes abiding hold
upon the memory, and makes the traveller recall anew the
civilisation he has left behind.</p>

<p>One of the Khartoom men disturbed my pensive contemplations
by pointing to the Shillooks, and making a remark
that they looked like Christians. I punished him with the
scornful reply to the effect that of whatever faith the savages
were, I could answer for it that they had the good luck to
be neither Jews nor Mohammedans.</p>

<p>A large <i lang="es">sombrero</i> of Mexican cut which protected my head
from the rays of the sun, excited the curiosity of the Shillooks.
On their own heads they wore a similar covering, except that
theirs was made from their own hair. I called their attention
to the great likeness between black men and white men, but
very great was their astonishment when they saw that my hair
could be taken off and put on again, which would be to them
very incredible. It might almost be said that they are
hardly born without their crests, which sometimes resemble
the comb of a guinea-fowl, and at other times seem to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
borrowed and designed from the aureoles which we admire in
Greek sacred pictures. Even while they are infants at the
breast, the hair is begun to be fastened into shape with gum-arabic
and ashes, and in course of time is permanently
brought into whatever form they please.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SWARM OF BEES.</div>

<p>The dreary steppe in the neighbourhood of Kaka contained
nothing that was worth the trouble of collecting. The dried-up
remains of vegetation had been completely annihilated
by fire. Accordingly I was anxious to proceed farther the
same day, that I might botanise in some undisturbed spot of
the primæval forest; my desire was, however, frustrated by
an incident which I do not even now remember without a
shudder. At the village the shore, as far as the eye could
reach, forms a treeless steppe; but at some little distance
the river is again bordered by a dense forest. A place was
soon reached, where the stream takes a remarkable bend,
and proceeds for eight miles in a north-easterly direction.
This place has the singular name of Dyoorab-el-Esh, or the
sack of corn. Now, as the north-east wind of course was
adverse to any north-east progress, it was necessary that the
boat should be towed by the crew. As the rope was being
drawn along through the grass on the banks it happened
that it disturbed a swarm of bees. In a moment, like a
great cloud, they burst upon the men who were dragging;
every one of them threw himself headlong into the water and
hurried to regain the boat. The swarm followed at their
heels, and in a few seconds filled every nook and cranny of
the deck. What a scene of confusion ensued may readily
be imagined.</p>

<p>Without any foreboding of ill, I was arranging my plants
in my cabin, when I heard all around me a scampering
which I took at first to be merely the frolics of my people,
as that was the order of the day. I called out to inquire
the meaning of the noise, but only got excited gestures and
reproachful looks in answer. The cry of “Bees! bees!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
soon broke upon my ear, and I proceeded to light a pipe.
My attempt was entirely in vain; in an instant bees in
thousands are about me, and I am mercilessly stung all over
my face and hands. To no purpose do I try to protect my
face with a handkerchief, and the more violently I fling my
hands about so much the more violent becomes the impetuosity
of the irritated insects. The maddening pain is
now on my cheek, now in my eye, now in my hair. The
dogs from under my bed burst out frantically, overturning
everything in their way. Losing well nigh all control over
myself, I fling myself in despair into the river; I dive down,
but all in vain, for the stings rain down still upon my head.
Not heeding the warnings of my people, I creep through the
reedy grass to the swampy bank. The grass lacerates my
hands, and I try to gain the mainland, hoping to find shelter
in the woods. All at once four powerful arms seize me and
drag me back with such force that I think I must be choked
in the mud. I am compelled to go back on board, and flight
is not to be thought of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEE-STINGS.</div>

<p>In the cooling moisture I had so far recovered my self-possession,
that it occurred to me to drag a sheet from my
chest, and this at last I found some protection, but I had
first gradually to crush the bees which I had enclosed with me
within this covering. Meantime by great self-denial and
courage on the part of my excellent people, my large dog was
brought on board to me and covered with cloths; the other, an
animal from Khartoom, was unfortunately lost. Cowering
down convulsively, I lingered out thus three full hours,
whilst the buzzing continued uninterruptedly, and solitary
stings penetrated periodically through the linen. Everyone
by degrees became equally passive as myself; at length a
perfect silence reigned on board; the bees subsided into
quietness. Meanwhile, some courageous men had crept
stealthily to the bank, and had succeeded in setting fire to
the reeds. The smoke rose to their assistance, and thus they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
contrived to scare away the bees from the boat, and, setting
it afloat, they drove it to the other bank. Had the thought
of the fire occurred at first, our misfortune would have
assumed a much milder character; but in the suddenness of
the attack everyone lost all presence of mind. Free from
further apprehension, we could now examine our injuries.
With the help of a looking-glass and a pair of pincers I
extracted all the stings from my face and hands, and inconvenience
in those places soon passed away. But it was
impossible to discover the stings in my hair; many of them
had been broken off short in the midst of the fray, and, remaining
behind, produced little ulcers which for two days
were acutely painful. Poor Arslan was terribly punished,
especially about the head; but the stings had clung harmlessly
in the long hair on his back. I was really sorry for
the loss of my nice little dog, which was never recovered,
and in all likelihood had been stung to death. These murderous
bees belong to the striped variety of our own honeybee.
A mishap like ours has been seldom experienced in the
waters of the White Nile. Consul Petherick, as his servants
informed me, had once to undergo a similar misfortune.
Our own grievance was not confined to ourselves: every
boat of the sixteen which that day were sailing in our track,
was pestered by the same infliction. No imagination can
adequately depict the confusion which must have spread in
boats where were crowded together from 60 to 80 men. I
felt ready, in the evening, for an encounter with half a score
of buffaloes or a brace of lions rather than have anything more
to do with bees; and this was a sentiment in which all the
ship’s company heartily concurred. I took my quinine and
awoke refreshed and cheerful; but several of the ill-used
members of our party were suffering from violent fever. My
own freedom from fever might perchance in a measure be
attributed to my involuntary vapour-bath. I had been
sitting muffled up for some hours in my wet clothes through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the heat of the day, and no vapour bath more effectual could
be contrived. Among the crews of the boats which followed
us there were two deaths, which ensued as the result of the
injuries which had been sustained.</p>

<p>On the day of the bee-visitation another insect had likewise
presented itself, which inflicted some sharpish stings, although
they were not attended by any continuous annoyance. It
was in itself an insignificant gadfly (<i lang="la">Tabanus</i>), which here
appears to play the part of the tsetse-fly, the natives declaring
of it that it injures the cattle. It is widely diffused
in the regions through which I travelled, and where the
tsetse seems to fail.</p>

<p>Our second day of misadventure came to an end; on the
following morning we were again passing along banks void
of trees. Towards midday we made a pause on the right
bank by a charming grove, where trailing creepers (<i lang="la">Leptadenia</i>)
dropped their pendants perpendicularly down, and
bound the spreading boughs of the Shubahi acacias (<i lang="la">A. verugera</i>)
to the ground, an apparatus admirably adapted to the
gymnastic frolics of the little apes. Wherever anyone
ventures to penetrate into the thickets he will not fail to
find countless traces of animal life; snake-skins and feathers
of many a species are scattered over the ground; tortoise-shells
and fish-bones, the remains of the eagle’s feast; bones
of animals; occasionally even human skeletons, perfectly
entire. On the shore are the shell-fish left by the high
water, especially the homes of the Ampularia (<i lang="la">A. Wernei</i>) as
large as one’s fist, in its way a giant amongst the mollusks of
the mighty river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMBATCH CANOES.</div>

<p>Warned by our experience we were ever on the alert
against bees, keeping in readiness a bundle of straw and some
faggots, in order to be able to kindle the dry grass immediately
we had accomplished our excursion on the land.
Towards midday we perceived with horror more bees in the
shore-grass, and lost no time in getting across to the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
bank. Here we came across numbers of Shillooks fishing in
their light canoes of ambatch; darting through the water
almost as swiftly as the fish themselves. This speed does not,
however, prevent them from having a waddling movement,
something like a duck, in their light craft. So light are
these canoes that one man can carry three of them on his
shoulder, although each canoe is capable of holding three
men. From a few dozen shoots of ambatch of about three
years’ growth, a canoe of this kind can be easily produced; at
about six feet high the stem goes rapidly off to a point, so
that a bundle of them needs only be tied together at the
extremities, and there is at once attained a curve that would
grace a gondola.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> To use these canoes adroitly requires considerable
practice, as the least shifting of the centre of
gravity is made at the risk of a capsize. Nevertheless, they
afforded me good service by taking me to the bank with dry
feet, and by enabling me to make botanical collections from
the floating bushes. When the Shillook has come to the end
of his voyage, he seizes his gondola like an ancient warrior
might his shield. He carries it, partly to ensure its safety
and partly to allow it to dry, because the ambatch wood easily
imbibes moisture and becomes saturated.</p>

<p>During our wanderings the crew had made a valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
discovery to replace the cracked middle of our long sailyard.
It consisted of a tolerably straight, though much knotted,
stem of Balanites; it was only 10 feet long, but was doubtless
found with much trouble, so rare are any trees that are
straight. The portion of the sailyard which had become
useless now fell under the axe; it was full of cracks, and
could no longer be held together by cow hide; the old bit
of northern pinewood, which had done service for years on
no one knows how many vessels or in how many latitudes,
had now reached the limit of its destiny here on the White
Nile, and was to be committed to the flames. Peace to its
ashes!</p>

<p>The width of the cultivated country appears to be about
ten miles, the whole of the left shore being dotted with
numerous small villages. We were not far from Fashoda,
the seat of the provincial government, and for the first time
availed ourselves of our store of glass beads to open a lively
trade with the Shillooks. But the beads had already so much
deteriorated in value that we were obliged to buy eggs,
fowls, and milk, quite at Khartoom market prices. The
poor savages insisted upon this as only right and fair; it
was in consequence of their transition from the monkey age
of man—&#8203;the termination, as it were, to them of the stone
and bronze period—&#8203;directly into the advanced condition of
citizens and payers of taxes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FASHODA.</div>

<p>Towards midday on the 24th of January we reached
Fashoda, and thus, after a prosperous progress, arrived at
the limit of the Egyptian empire. Fashoda is the seat of
a Mudir, provided with a garrison for the maintenance of
Egyptian power. The complete subjection of the entire
Shillook country did not, however, follow until two years
later. The governor for a considerable time resided six
leagues from the town, where he was quartered with 500
soldiers, in order to bring to reason the southern Shillooks,
who were by no means inclined to submit. During this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
time the armed force in Fashoda did not consist of more
than 200 men.</p>

<p>The erection of anything like a town had only been begun
within the last two years. The place was formerly called
Denab, and now consisted of merely a large mass of conical
huts of straw, besides the remarkable structure which constituted
the fort. The long boundary walls of the fort, with
their hundreds of waterspouts, looked at a distance as though
they were mounted with so many cannon, and presented a
formidable appearance. In reality the number of cannon
which the fort could boast was only four, the rest of the field
ordnance being in the camp of the Mudir. His deputy
received me very courteously. As a present he sent me at
once two fat wethers, and placed at my disposal his boats,
mules, horses, soldiers—&#8203;in short, everything that could assist
me to inspect the neighbourhood in comfort.</p>

<p>On account of the shallowness of the water on the side on
which the town is built, the boat was moored close by a
narrow island which was connected with the mainland by a
kind of jetty composed of faggots. This at the time of high
water serves as a mole for any boats that may arrive, which
are then able to lie close alongside the doors. Before the
walls of the town, on a terrace left dry by the sunken flood,
extend fields and vegetable gardens, which the Governor,
following the Egyptian fashion, has caused to be planted.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
This is the southern limit of the wheat culture in the Eastern
Soudan.</p>

<p>The neighbouring country consists of steppes, over which,
as far as the eye can see, larger and smaller groups of Shillook
huts rise from the grass. The demand of wood for the
use of the troops has caused the larger trees everywhere to
be miserably mutilated, and the few boats which are at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
disposal of the Government have enough to do in procuring
fuel for the heating of the steamer stationed there.
Every branch as it grows is immediately cut off, and the
naked stems of the acacias, once so magnificent on account
of their massive proportions, are alone able to defy the
meagre tools Fashoda can supply.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br>
 <img src="images/i_080.jpg"
 alt="View of Fashoda">
 <p class="caption">View of Fashoda.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->
 
<p>For three years, it is said, there has been an undisturbed
peace here, that is to say, in the environs of Fashoda; up
to that time, outbreaks more or less violent, on the part of
the negro settlers, had been the order of the day. Near a
withered Adansonia, less than a mile from the walls, the
spot was pointed out to me where the cannon of the fortress
was for the last time called into action. A well-directed
shot had mown down fifteen men at once from a single party
who were taking advantage of the rainy season and the high
grass to make an attack. The fatal shot was decisive, and
the attack was abandoned. From among the bones of the
Shillooks killed on that day I selected from a neighbouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
pit nine skulls in good preservation, the investigation of
which has furnished some material evidence towards the
ethnography of Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TENT ON THE BANK.</div>

<p>All boats are compelled to stop for several days at Fashoda,
partly to complete their corn-stores, and partly on account
of the poll-tax, to submit to an inspection of the papers,
which contain the lists of the crew and soldiers. Hence it
happens that throughout January and February Fashoda life
is pretty brisk. Egyptian galley-slaves, wearing no fetters—&#8203;escape
being as difficult as in Siberia—&#8203;loitered on the shore
begging, and pestered me with scraps of French and Italian.
This I found by no means agreeable. After the cramped
dimensions of my cabin, I longed for wider freedom to my
limbs; accordingly I had a tent pitched upon the bank,
but from fear of thieves it was obliged to be continually
guarded by men with loaded guns. Many boats came and
went, wending their way to the Upper Nile waters; all
reported that more or less they had been sufferers from the
bees in Dyoorab-el-Esh. I was told that the whole crew of
one boat was obliged to remain in the water from noon till
evening, now and then raising their heads to get air, but
always under the penalty of getting some dozen fresh stings.</p>

<p>The weather during these days was very cool, for a strong
north-east wind blew incessantly with such violence, that at
daybreak we had usually a temperature of only 62° Fahr.
Even the hippopotamuses seemed to find it over cool in the
water, for at sunrise they appeared <i lang="fr">en masse</i> on a neighbouring
sandbank: amongst them I found a suitable target on
which to try the effect of the full-sized ball which my large
elephant gun carried.</p>

<p>I was continually bewildered by the jokes and buffoonery
of the crews, for whom jesting seemed a necessity of life.
Nothing was done without bad puns. There was an undying
<i lang="fr">esprit amusant</i>, whose flow was unchecked alike by day and
night. Whenever any one did a thing which could be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
ridiculous, he was received with a volley of cheers of “Hue!
hue!” (there he is). The merissa beer of Fashoda, served out
in gourd-shells—&#8203;pints and pots being here unknown—&#8203;naturally
is not without its influence in promoting this perpetual
folly. The love of jocoseness among these people is not
confined to the young, but makes them, even when advanced
in years, as merry and as naïve as children.</p>

<p>Some Arab names are as generally common as our own
Brown and Smith; on our boat alone we had six Mohammeds;
for distinction, therefore, each of these had to be assigned his
special nickname. One was called Abu-Asherah (the man
with ten fathers); another Berdawily (the chilly one). The
others were designated by epithets more or less poetical, as
father of the virgin, or sheikh of the women. My Mohammed,
who had the <i lang="fr">rencontre</i> with the buffalo, was sufficiently distinguished
by his appellation of Amin, the faithful, but he
was also jocosely known as “the swimmer.” He had once
been the means of losing a boat which a merchant had
entrusted to his care, and had only escaped by swimming to
shore, a feat which acquired for him the satire associated
with his name.</p>

<p>An occurrence, which I can hardly say surprised me, but
which I had expected hourly from amongst the Arab idlers,
alarmed us on the first evening of our arrival. The gun of
one of our soldiers went off accidentally, and the ball
whistled across our boat. On the following morning, through
similar carelessness, a slave of one of the Government
officials received a shot through his arm, for which the
offender had to pay 150 dollars, a sum which had to be
raised from the entire crew, because, as they said, they were
all liable to the same accident. I had myself only narrowly
escaped being hit by the first mishap, and the captain
(although generally he was most considerate towards his
crew), acting as Ghattas’ agent, fell with great severity upon
the offender. By the judgment of the majority, to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the Nubians ever appeal, the fellow was assigned some dozen
lashes of the kurbatch, which he was thrown down on the
deck to receive, and which he bore without a murmur.</p>

<p>The right side of the main stream at Fashoda is not the
mainland, but is a long island, which extends for several
leagues above and below. Beyond the true eastern shore
the Dinka are said to be settled in extensive villages, and at
that time still furnished an inexhaustible supply of slaves to
the marauding expeditions of the garrison of Fashoda. In
1870, Baker succeeded in putting an end to this disorder, the
knowledge of which penetrated to the most remote tribes.
The Dinka tribes of that region are called Dang-Yoht, Dang-Yahl,
Behr, Nyell, and Abelang.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KILLING A BOA.</div>

<p>The shore opposite Fashoda contains wide bush-forests and
unlimited supplies of wood. During one of my excursions
thither I killed an enormous African boa, the Python
Sebæ. It was about fifteen feet in length, not above the
average size to which the species attains; in Gallabat I have
frequently seen them over twenty feet. The speedy death
of this huge reptile by a charge of heavy shot, of which
only four grains hit, struck me as very remarkable. The
skin was brilliantly spotted, and yielded admirable material
for making a waterproof gun-case.</p>

non-arrival of the boats bound for the Gazelle River compelled
us, because our force was not sufficiently numerous to
overcome by ourselves the obstacles which the “Sett,” or
grass-barrier, would present, and also inadequate for protection
against an attack, which was not improbable, from the
hitherto unsubdued residents.</p>

<p>A wider ramble, in which I inspected several Shillook
villages, led me farther into the country, and gave me some
conception of its thronging population. The Turkish officer,
who welcomed me like a countryman because I was European,
attended me, followed by a number of soldiers, all of
us being mounted. Although throughout this tour, I was
not offered even a bowl of fresh milk, and saw little beyond
what had already come under my observation, viz., grey and
rusty-red beings, innumerable conical huts, and countless
herds of cattle; yet I could not be otherwise than impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">by various details which appeared characteristic of</span><br>
this people, now incorporated as Egyptian subjects, and which
I shall proceed to relate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHILLOOK STATISTICS.</div>

<p>The Shillook tribe inhabits the entire left bank of the
White Nile, occupying a territory about 200 miles long and
about ten miles wide, and which extends right to the mouth
of the Gazelle River. Hemmed in by the Baggara on the
west, it is prevented by the river from extending itself farther
eastward, and only the lower course of the Sobat has any of
the Shillooks for its denizens. Their subjection to Egyptian
government, which was completed in 1871, has caused a
census to be taken of all the villages on the left bank of the
Nile, which resulted in an estimate of about 3000. Taking
the character of the villages into account this would give a
total of above a million souls for this portion of the Shillooks
alone. Now the Shillook land, which lies upon the White
Nile, has an extent of hardly less than 2000 square miles,
and when the number of heads upon this is compared with
those in the populous districts of Europe we are justified in
reckoning from 600 to 625 to a square mile; a result altogether
similar is arrived at from a reckoning based on the
estimate of there being 3000 villages, each village having
huts varying in number from 45 to 200, and each hut
averaging 4 or 5 occupants; this would give a total of about
1,200,000. This, in fact, is an estimate corresponding entirely
with what the Mudir of Fashoda, who was conversant
with the details of all state affairs, had already communicated
to me in 1869.</p>

<p>No known part of Africa, scarcely even the narrow valley
of the Nile in Egypt, has a density of population so great;
but a similar condition of circumstances, so favourable to the
support of a teeming population, is perhaps without a
parallel in the world. Everything which contributes to the
exuberance of life here finds a concentrated field—&#8203;agriculture,
pasturage, fishing, and the chase. Agriculture is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
rendered easy by the natural fertility of the soil, by the
recurrence of the rainy seasons, by irrigation effected by the
rising of the river, assisted by numerous canals, and by an
atmosphere ordinarily so overclouded as to moderate the
radiance of the sun, and to retain throughout the year perpetual
moisture. Of fishing there is plenty. There are
crocodiles and hippopotamuses in abundance. Across the
river there is a free and open chase over wildernesses which
would advantageously be built upon, but for the hostility of
the neighbouring Dinka. The pasture lands are on the same
side of the river as the dwellings; they are just beyond the
limits of the cultivated plots; occasionally they are subject
to winter drought, and at times liable to incursions from the
Baggara; but altogether they are invaluable as supplying
daily resorts for the cattle.</p>

<p>Still further proof of the superabundance of population of
the Shillooks is manifest from the emigration which goes
forward in a south-westerly direction, where considerable
numbers of them, the Dembo and Dyoor, have settled on
the border-lands between the Bongo and Dinka. Of these,
however, I will speak hereafter; I will only pause now to
remark how, in vivid contrast to the monotonous uniformity
of nature which ordinarily asserts itself throughout vast
tracts of Central Africa, there are even exhibited diversities
of human development, differences of dialect, and peculiarities
of bodily conformation. In the Shillook territory
there are probably no less than 600 residents to the square
mile, whilst in Bongo-land, within 180 miles to the south-west,
there would be found hardly a dozen occupants on an equal
area. Again, between lat. 5° and 1° N., within a range of not
more than 300 miles, are to be found examples of the largest
and of the smallest races of mankind—&#8203;the Bari and the
Akkah, of which the former might rival the Patagonians in
stature, the latter being scarcely taller than Esquimaux, and
considerably below a medium height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SHILLOOK VILLAGES.</div>

<p>It should be appended to what has been said about the
villages, that the entire west bank of the Nile, as far as the
confines of the district reach, assumes the appearance of one
single village, of which the sections are separated by intervals
varying from 300 to 1000 paces. These clusters of huts
are built with surprising regularity, and are so closely
crowded together that they cannot fail to suggest the comparison
with a thick mass of fungus or mushrooms. Every
village has its overseer, whilst the overseers of fifty or
seventy, or sometimes of 100 villages, are subject to a superintendent,
who has the control of what may be called a
“district,” and of such districts there are well nigh a hundred,
each of them distinguished by its particular name.
One of the descendants of the ancient kings had been reduced
to entire subjection under the Government; another at
the period of my first visit was still resisting to the utmost.</p>

<p>In the centre of each village there is a circular space
where, evening after evening, the inhabitants congregate,
and, either stretched upon hides or squatting down on mats
of ambatch, inhale the vapour from burning heaps of cow-dung
to keep off the flies, or from pipes with enormous clay bowls
smoke the tobacco of the country.</p>

<p>In these spaces there is frequently erected the great stem
of a tree, on which according to common African usage
kettledrums are hung and used for the purpose of warning
the inhabitants of any impending danger, and of communicating
intelligence to the neighbourhood. Most of the
negro tribes are distinguished by the form of their huts.
The huts of the Shillooks are built with higher walls than
those of the Dinka, and, as an ordinary rule, are of smaller
circumference; the conical roofs do not rise to a peak, but
are rather in the shape of flattened domes, and in this way it
is that they acquire the singular resemblance to mushrooms
of which I have spoken. The villages are not enclosed externally,
but are bounded by fences made of straw-mats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
running between the closely-crammed houses, and which
serve for shelter to the cattle of individual householders.
Great grazing-plots, such as the larger villages combine to
provide for the benefit of the community, and exist amongst
the Dinka, cannot be secured for the Shillooks, because they
are comparatively limited for space.</p>

<p>Now although these savages are altogether unacquainted
with the refined cosmetics of Europe, they make use of
cosmetics of their own; viz., a coating of ashes for protection
against insects. When the ashes are prepared from wood
they render the body perfectly grey, and hereby are known
the poor; when the ashes are obtained from cow-dung they
give a rusty-red tint, the hue of red devils, and hereby can
be recognised the landowners. Ashes, dung, and the urine
of cows are the indispensable requisites of the toilet. The
item last named affects the nose of the stranger rather unpleasantly
when he makes use of any of their milk-vessels, as,
according to a regular African habit, they are washed with
it, probably to compensate for a lack of salt.</p>

<p>The external appearance of the Shillooks, therefore, is by
no means agreeable, but rather offensive to the beholder,
who will hardly fail to notice amongst all the negro people
who dwell in the plains of the Upper Nile a singular want
of the lower incisor teeth, which in early life are always
broken off. Their physiognomy hardly offers that decided
negro type which their swarthy complexion would lead one
to expect. To judge by the shape of the skull, this people
belongs to the less degraded races of Central Africa, which
are distinguished from other negro stocks by a smaller
breadth of jaw and by a less decided narrowness of head.
A comparison which I made with the skulls which I had
collected and some which were taken from ancient Egyptian
graves, and with the heads of living fellahs, established the
fact of a remarkable resemblance. According to Professor
R. Hartmann of Berlin, the similarity between the heads of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
ancient Egyptians and the Shillooks rests on the projection
of the nasal bones; to have these so deeply set as to appear
compressed by the forehead, would seem to be discordant
with the general type of negro races. Without pronouncing
any decided opinion as to the actual relationship of the Egyptian
to the Shillook, that eminent <i lang="fr">savant</i> thinks that he at
least discerns a fresh proof of an unquestionable African origin
of the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHILLOOK MEN.</div>

<p>Entirely bare of clothing, the bodies of the men would not
of themselves be ungraceful, but through the perpetual
plastering over with ashes, they assume a thoroughly
diabolical aspect. The movements of their lean bony limbs
are so languid, and their repose so perfect, as not rarely to
give the Shillooks the resemblance of mummies; and whoever
comes as a novice amongst them can hardly resist the
impression that in gazing at these ash-grey forms he is looking
upon mouldering corpses rather than upon living beings.</p>

<p>The stature of the Shillook is very moderate, and, as a
general rule, is short compared with that of the lank, and
long-legged Dinka.</p>

<p>Like most of the naked and half-naked Africans they
devote the greatest attention to the arrangement of their
hair; on every other portion of the body all growth of hair is
stopped by its being all carefully plucked out at the very
first appearance. As has been already observed, amongst the
men the repeated application of clay, gum, or dung, so
effectually clots the hair together that it retains as it were
voluntarily the desired form; at one time like a comb, at
another like a helmet, or, it may be, like a fan. Many of
the Shillook men present in this respect a great variety. A
good many wear transversely across the skull a comb as
broad as a man’s hand, which, like a nimbus of tin, stretches
from ear to ear, and terminates behind in two drooping
circular lappets. Occasionally there are heads for which one
comb does not suffice, and on these several combs, parallel to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
one another at small intervals are arranged in lines. There
is a third form, far from uncommon, than which nothing can
be more grotesque. It may be compared to the crest of a
guinea fowl, of which it is an obvious imitation; just as
among ourselves many a way of dressing the hair would
seem to be designed by taking some animal form for a
model.</p>

<p>Every now and then, however, one meets with heads of
which the hair is closely cropped. However it may have
happened, whether from illness or from some misadventure in
dressing the hair, or perhaps from a fall of which the consequence
has been an accident to the ponderous head-gear, I
hardly know how, but something always seems wanting to
such heads. In such cases there is frequently seen a comical-looking
bandage fixed over the brow, forming a shade for the
eyes, and which is made of a giraffe’s foxy-red mane clipped
short. This has been elsewhere observed, and is not unknown
amongst the Kaffirs of South Africa. Thus much for the
men.</p>

<p>As far as regards the women—&#8203;I saw none except those
whose short-cropped hair appeared stippled over with fresh-sprouting
woolly locks, and resembled the skin of a new-born
lamb, like the “Astrachan” of commerce. The women do
not go entirely naked, but wear an apron of calf-skin, which
is bound round their loins, and reaches to their knees.</p>

<p>Just like the Dinka, whose external habits, apart from
their hair-combs, they would appear almost entirely to
follow, every man amongst them ordinarily carries a club-shaped
crutch, nearly three feet in length, with a heavy
round knob at its upper end, but which tapers down to a
point at the other extremity, so that it resembles a gigantic
nail. Their only arms are their long spiked lances, of which
(to judge from the equivalents taken in exchange) one is
valued at a Maria Theresa dollar. Bows and arrows are just as
unknown amongst them as amongst the neighbouring Dinka,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
whilst, on the contrary, amongst the Nueir they are the chief
weapons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHILLOOK ANIMALS.</div>

<p>The domestic animals which the Shillooks breed are oxen,
sheep, and goats, the same kinds as hereafter we shall find
amongst the Dinka; besides these, they keep poultry and
dogs; other animals are scarce, and probably could not
endure the climate. Throughout the country dogs abound,
in shape like greyhounds, but in size hardly equal to our
pointers. They are almost always of a foxy-red colour, with
a black muzzle, much elongated; they are short-haired and
sleek, and have long tails, smooth as those of rats; their
ears are tolerably long, the upper portion being flabby and
ragged, and therefore drooping forward. Almost beyond
example in their activity in leaping and running, so fleet are
they that with the greatest ease they outrun the gazelle, and
are everywhere of service in the chase; over the earth-walls
ten feet high, and over ant-hills, they bound with the celerity
of cats, and can jump three or four times the length of their
own slim bodies. I kept a number of genuine Shillook dogs,
which subsequently did very well in the farther interior,
and increased considerably. Like all dogs of the Nile district,
from the Egyptian pariah to the village cur of the
Soudan, this breed is always found to be deficient in the dew-claws
of the hind foot, which always exist in our European
dogs. As a general rule, it may be said that the Shillook
dog differs little from the races of the Bedouins of Kordofan
and of Sennaar.</p>

<p>The only conception which the Shillook entertain of a
higher existence is limited to their reverence for a certain
hero, who is called the Father of their race, and who is
supposed to have conducted them to the land which they at
present occupy. In case of famine, or in order that they
may have rain, or that they may reap a good harvest, they
call upon him by name. They imagine of the dead that
they are lingering amongst the living and still attend them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
It is with them as with other uncultivated children of nature,
that old traditions and veneration of ancestors supply the
place of religious legends or ethic system.</p>

<p>Late in the evening of the 1st of February we left Fashoda,
and proceeded, without using the sail, for the greatest part of
the night along the left bank. At daybreak we arrived at
the Egyptian camp. We were received with singing, shouting,
and the braying of trumpets. I was conducted by the
Governor to his tent, and whilst, hour after hour, we smoked
our pipes in company, I related to him the most recent
events in the political world. After talking to him about
the sources of the Nile, and the campaign of the English in
Abyssinia, I told him of the events of the “Seven Days’ War,”
in return for which I was presented with a fine bullock and
several sheep and goats. The encampment, as I found, consisted
of some huts erected with straw in a very off-hand
way, the irregular forms of which contrasted very disadvantageously
with the symmetrical regularity which is so
conspicuous in the dwellings of the Shillooks. Military tents
and awnings of sedge completed the equipment of the camp.
An ordinary thorn hedge with two loopholes, in which a
cannon was always placed, protected the spot, which was close
to the left bank of the river. In the Mudir’s verandah I also
made acquaintance with the Shillook chief, to whom I before
alluded, who had entirely surrendered to the Egyptian
Government, and was now, as the Governor expressed himself,
“coming to his senses.” There was no external indication
whatever of his rank, except a miserable rag which
hung about his loins, or the common sandals which he wore,
might be considered such. His short-cropped hair had no
covering; his neck had a row of beads, such as the heads of
families are accustomed to wear, worth about a couple of
groschen; and this was all the decoration he displayed. He
retained now but a shadow of his former power; his better
days were gone, days in which, attended by a council of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
ancestral state, he had swayed the sceptre of patriarchal
dignity. Of all the negro races which occupy the entire
district of the Nile, the Shillooks used to uphold the most
perfectly regulated government, and to appreciate them
thoroughly it is necessary to refer back to the earliest registries,
which those who accompanied the expedition of
Mehemet Ali left on record. But now this condition is all
changed, and everything has disappeared which gave this
independent and primitive people their most striking
characteristics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHILLOOK SUBMISSION.</div>

<p>In the immediate proximity of the camp all was generally
at peace; the Shillooks apparently submitted tamely enough
to a Government which did not exercise any very tyrannical
power, and which contented itself with demanding a supply
of bullocks and a stated levy of provisions to maintain the
troops. Notwithstanding this usual semblance of concord,
the Governor was notoriously on terms of open enmity and
feud with the Shillooks in the south. Kashgar, another
descendant of the ancient reigning family, still maintained
himself as an uncontrolled sovereign, and was able to render
that part of the river extremely unsafe for navigation. Ever
and again the Governor with his force, never more than 600
strong, was undertaking expeditions against them; but, as
he himself told me, they never came to an actual engagement.
Although the blacks, he said, might muster 20,000
or 30,000 strong, the second cannon shot was quite enough
to make them scamper off, and leave their flocks and herds
in the lurch; upon these the mounted Baggara, in the service
of the Government, descended and made them an easy
spoil. This nomadic race, from time immemorial, has ever,
as I have already mentioned, been addicted to the plunder
of cattle, and has always exhibited a preference for that
occupation.</p>

<p>In another respect the situation of the Government here
is far from easy. Not only are the Shillooks at heart at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
enmity to it, but it excites the hostility of the trading companies
who ascend the river. Nothing indicates the circumstances
better than the expression of a member of one of
these companies. “The Mudir,” he said, “doesn’t like to
attack the Shillooks; he takes care of them, and only wants
a few of their bullocks; but we—&#8203;we should just like to
annihilate them, devil’s brood as they are.” In fact, as the
Mudir said to me, he only wanted the best of the Shillooks;
the Shillooks know well enough that their “best” is their
cattle, and this they are not really resigned passively to
surrender, and so they go on and continue to be defiant, till
they feel the grenades and rockets scorching their skins.
For the future fortune of this favoured country I cannot
anticipate much that is good. Whilst the Viceroy refuses
to appoint Europeans as governors, like Munzinger in
Massowa, his officers must fail in those qualifications which
would be adequate for the successful administration of a
newly-acquired negro territory. The visible retrogression of
the Egyptian Soudan with respect to cultivation, confirms
this unfavourable foreboding. Ismail Pasha centres all his
hope upon the stimulating influence of a railway which shall
connect Egypt with Khartoom, and very likely he may
witness commerce enlarged to an unsuspected magnitude;
one thing, however, there is which he cannot prevent, and
that is the depopulation of the Shillook lands. Since they
remain closed to European civilisation, and since the husbandmen
in Egypt are sufficiently engrossed in acquiring
fresh soil for their own tillage at home, there is no prospect
whatever for any advantage to these lands, except it can be
found in a large immigration of labourers from Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JUDICIAL VERDICT.</div>

<p>The Governor was a remarkably intelligent Kurd, and
great was my regret that I could not spare a longer time to
listen to the interesting information that he gave me about
the habits of the Shillooks, which he knew accurately from
many years’ experience. I accepted all that he said with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the greater confidence, because it had seldom occurred to me
to meet a Turkish officer, who could fluently speak the
dialect of the country. He was continually being called
upon to adjust the disputes of the natives, who appealed to
his judgment, even in their most private concerns. One
young girl there was who, abashed and dejected, had been
crouching in a corner, and then ventured to present herself
before him as adjudicator. With her speech half-choked by
emotion, she besought him to interpose his authority to set
aside the obstacles which her parents threw in the way of
her completing her marriage engagement with a young
Shillook, whose name was Yōd. The hindrance to the wedding
was simply the fact that the young man possessed no
cattle. The Mudir inquired whether Yōd was not the owner
of some cows. Her reply was, “No; Yōd has no cows; but
Yōd wants me, and I want Yōd.” Although she urged her
point over and over again, and pressed the Mudir to pronounce
in her favour, because his judgment would constrain
her parents, the Mudir did not yield. The girl kept saying
“we must,” and “we will;” the judge could speak only of
bullocks. There seemed to be no settling the matter, when
he said, “You must go and wait: wait till Yōd has bullocks
enough to satisfy your parents.” This was not a very comforting
decision, but it showed me plainly how that it was
ever his rule to recognise the customs of the country.</p>

<p>In order to attend to my European correspondence, which
had fallen somewhat into arrears during my voyage, I prolonged
my stay for three days. Pine forests of gum-acacias
encompassed the spot as far as the extensive Shillook villages
allowed them space, whilst the opposite shore presented an
unreclaimed desert. At this season, when the waters had
nearly reached their lowest level, the banks of the river were
everywhere enlivened by numerous kinds of water-fowl.
Ducks and geese did not preponderate, as in the northern
districts, but the bird most frequently seen was the crowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
crane. Thousands of these in swarms were to be seen upon
the level banks, nor was there much difficulty in getting at
them. Protected by the tall grasses on the slopes of the
bank, one had but to discharge a load of good-sized shot, and
the destruction was marvellous. Besides the black and rose-coloured
storks there is occasionally found the common stork,
familiar to us at home; deeper onwards in the interior I
have always looked for this in vain. In every region throughout
Africa there exists the rapacious hawk, whilst the
graceful grey falcon is not at all uncommon. The most
remarkable bird of prey, however, is the large whitey-brown
eagle (<i lang="la">Haliaëtos vocifer</i>), which, sitting apart on trees and
shrubs in the proximity of the waters, startles the passer-by
by its peculiar shriek.</p>

<p>The noise of this bird is very singular, and is unlike any other
known note of the feathered race; its cry ever comes unexpectedly,
and is prolonged on the waters. Sometimes it
makes one think that it must be the cry of frightened women
which alarms him; or sometimes it appears as if a lot of
shouting boys were rushing from their hiding-place. The
illusion is so perfect, that, for my part, I never failed to hurry
off in the direction of the sound, whenever I chanced to hear
it. The peculiar cry of the bird is so characteristic, that the
inhabitants of the Soudan have given it the expressive name
of Faki, the shrieking priest.</p>

<p>Of birds which attach themselves to inhabited parts, the
white-breasted Abyssinian raven is most abundant; the trees
around Fashoda are full of them. This species dwells in
pairs, which are continually hacking away at the tree stems,
the raven not unfrequently coming to associate with them.
The Rahama, consecrated (as an emblem of parental affection)
amongst the ancient Egyptians and Hebrews, collects in
considerable numbers in Khartoom, where it does duty as a
scavenger; but although it is ever to be found in the towns
of Egypt and Nubia, it is never met with here; it shuns the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
wilderness, and only feels at home in civilised places. In
this district its place is supplied by the little carrion vulture
(<i lang="la">Neophron pileatus</i>), which the people of the Soudan call
“Nisr,” although this is only the ordinary Arabian appellation
of an eagle. The heaths, broken as they frequently are
by low shrubs, notwithstanding the nearness of so many
dwellings, afford a suitable resort for whole coveys of guinea-fowls.
The herbage on the steppe itself appears for miles
together to be covered with the Bamia (<i lang="la">Hibiscus esculentus</i>),
a species of marsh-mallow, the seed-pods of which form a
favourite vegetable amongst the Nubians. By the White
Nile it grows perfectly wild, whilst in the north it requires
to be cultivated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACACIA-GROVES.</div>

<p>The acacia-groves produce gum in such unlimited quantities
that, in the interests of commerce, they are specially
worthy of regard. In the winter time, with the greatest ease
in the course of a day a hundredweight of this valuable
article could be collected by one man. Not once, however,
did I see anyone gathering the gum, although the merchants
of Khartoom are never in a position to supply sufficient to
meet the demands of Europe. The descriptions of gum,
which are hence brought to the Khartoom market, are those
known as Sennaari and Talha, and are, in truth, only of a
mediocre quality. Yet they do possess a certain marketable
value, and through their abundance could be made to render
a very large profit. The acacia-groves extend over an area
a hundred miles square, and stretch along the right bank of
the stream. The kind which is most conspicuous is the
<i lang="la">A. fistula</i>, and which is as rich as any other variety in gummy
secretions. I choose this definition of it from its Arabian
appellation “soffar,” which signifies a flute or pipe. From
the larvæ of insects which have worked a way to the inside,
their ivory-white shoots are often distorted in form and
swollen out at their base with globular bladders measuring
about an inch in diameter. After the mysterious insect has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
unaccountably managed to glide out of its circular hole, this
thorn-like shoot becomes a sort of musical instrument, upon
which the wind as it plays produces the regular sound of a
flute; on this account, the natives of the Soudan have named
it the whistling-tree. It yields a portion of the gum known
on the exchange as gum of Gedaref. It is often found
in lumps as large as the fist; it is rarely colourless, and
more frequently than otherwise tinged with the hue of
amber.</p>

<p>Very striking is the sight afforded by the wood of acacias
in the months of winter; the boughs, bare of leaves and
white as chalk, stretch out like ghosts; they are covered
with the empty pods, which cluster everywhere like flakes
of snow; whilst the voices of a thousand flutes give out their
hollow dirge. Such is the forest of the Soffar.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption">Prickles of Acacia.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The peculiarities which affect the growth of the acacia
appear to be transmitted to a very remarkable extent. On
a former journey I took some seeds to Cairo, which already
had produced some trees of a very considerable size. These
trees exhibited the special appearances of the parents;
below the prickles were the same excrescences and insect-borings;
not only was this the case in the park of Esbekieh
in Cairo, but it also occurred in several other situations,
which left the problem to be solved, how was it that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>

<div class="sidenote">ABOO SAMMAT.</div>

<p>On the 5th of February we finally left the Egyptian encampment,
and directed our course up the stream towards
the region of the papyrus. After sailing all night we
stopped just short of the mouth of the Sobat, on the right
bank close to a forest. The progress of the coming days
would lead us through an insecure territory; we wanted to
make up our supply of wood, and knew that the hostility of
the Shillooks would, in many places, render any attempt at
landing on our part quite unadvisable. Of the boats which
were bound for the Gazelle, only one had arrived. In order
to render us assistance, the Mudir had charged the owner
not to leave my party in the lurch. This circumstance had
a very important effect upon my whole journey, as it was the
means of introducing me to Mohammed Aboo Sammat, who
was proprietor of the boat. This magnanimous Nubian was
destined to exercise a very considerable influence on my
undertaking, and, indeed, he contributed more to my success
than all the satraps of the Soudan. During my land
journey I had first made his acquaintance, and now he
invited me to be his guest until he should have accompanied
me to the remotest tribes, a proposal on his part which made
my blood tingle in my veins. A native of Dar-Kenoos, in his
way he was a little hero. Sword in hand he had vanquished
various districts large enough to have formed small states in
Europe. A merchant full of enterprise, he avoided no
danger, and was sparing neither of trouble nor of sacrifice;
in the words of the Horaz, “he explored the distant Indies,
and compassed sea and land to escape poverty.” Yet all the
while he had the keenest sympathy with learning, and could
travel through the remotest countries at the bidding of
science to see the wonders of the world.</p>

<p>Far as eye can see, the Sobat flows between level banks
bounded by unlimited steppes; where it joins the Nile it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
about half as broad as the main stream. For a considerable
distance the cloudy milk-white waters, which indicate the
mountain stream, can be distinguished as they roll into the
deep azure of the White Nile. The Sobat water is, however,
far preferable to the Nile water, which, after being strained
as it were, through a filter of grass, emerges transparent in
colour, but with a flat, earthy flavour, which is highly disagreeable
to the palate. The effect of the commingling of
the two streams can be distinctly traced as far as Fashoda,
where the inhabitants fancy they enjoy some consequent
sanitary advantage.</p>

<p>We kept quite close to the right bank of the uninhabited
quarter, but on the same day we found ourselves in full
flight before thousands of the native Shillooks, who, with
their light canoes of ambatch, hastened to the bank, and in
thick troops prepared to displace us. As fate would have it,
just as we were within sight of the dreaded Shillooks, our sailyard
broke, and we were compelled to seek the land. Soon
rose the cry, “They are coming! they are coming!” for in
fact we could see them dashing over the stream with incredible
celerity, and crowding their canoes as thick as ants.
Hardly had we regained our craft, and made some speedy
preparations for defence against an attack, when the foremost
of the Shillook men, equipped for war, carrying their
tufted lances in their hands, showed themselves by the banks
which only now we had quitted. Apparently they came to
offer some negotiation with us in the way of traffic; but ours
was the ancient policy, “Danaos timentes,” and we pushed on.</p>

<p>Although, including Aboo Saramat’s party, we numbered
full eighty armed men, we could not help suspecting that as
soon as the north-east breeze should drop, by whose aid we
were going along the stream without a sail, the savages
would take advantage of our bad situation and inadequate
fighting force to make an attack upon us.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<div class="sidenote">A HASTY RETREAT.</div>

<p>This fear was not without reason; there were here, at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
guess, at least 10,000 Shillooks on their legs and 3000
ambatch canoes in motion on the river. Accordingly we
pushed up the stream, and had an opportunity, from a more
secure neighbourhood, to observe the Shillooks more accurately.
My telescope aided me in my investigation. I saw
crowds of men violently gesticulating and contending; I
saw women burdened with baskets loaded with poultry
clapping their wings. After a while the Shillooks, disappointed,
began to vacate the bank which we had left, and on
the river could now be seen a redoubled movement of the
canoes, whilst opposite fresh multitudes poured in, and gave
to the whole scene the appearance of a general emigration of
the people.</p>

<p>Within the last three years the boats had been permitted
with reluctance, and only when several were together, to
approach the shore at this part of the stream, for here it had
happened in one single season that five vessels, the property
of Khartoom merchants, as they were coming down the river
laden with ivory, were treacherously attacked one after the
other. The stratagem was employed of diverting the attention
of the crews by an exhibition of attractive merchandise;
while the Nubians were off their guard, at a given signal the
Shillooks fell upon them and butchered them without exception.
Gunpowder, rifles, and valuable ivory, all fell into
their hands; the vessels they burnt. Ghattas himself, the
merchant who owned the vessel by which I was travelling,
suffered the loss of a costly cargo, while eighty men on that
occasion met with a violent death. Only the Reis and one
female slave escaped to Fashoda. Betimes they threw
themselves into the water, and concealing their heads with
some water weeds, floated on till the stream carried them out
of the reach of harm.</p>

<p>On the following morning, after we had passed the mouth
of the Giraffe river, we were joined by a flotilla of six boats.
As we reckoned now nearly 350 armed men, we felt that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
could venture without risk to enter upon commercial transactions
with the Shillooks. The disturbed condition of the
country had interfered to prevent them carrying about their
merchandise as usual, and they now were collected in unusual
numbers at the mart.</p>

<p>A mile away from the river-bank there were rows of dome-palms
bounding a broad level, on which was exhibited all
the liveliness of ordinary market-clatter. Busy and bustling,
there were thousands congregated together; but the fear this
time was not on our side. From far and near streamed in
the natives; many brought baskets full of corn, eggs, butter,
beans, and ostrich-feathers; others offered poultry, tied
together in bunches, for sale: there was altogether the bustle
of such a market as only the largest towns could display.
The area was hemmed in by a guard of armed men, whose
lances, like standing corn, glittered in the sun. The sense
of security raised the spirits of the light-hearted sailors, and
their merry Nubian songs rose cheerfully in the air. Two
hours slipped quickly away, while the necessary purchases
were being made, the medium of exchange being white or
red glass beads. Soon afterwards a favourable breeze
sprung up. Everything was still active in the market;
fresh loads came teeming from the villages; the outcry and
gesticulations of the market people were as excited as ever,
when suddenly there boomed the signal to embark. The
confusion, the noise, the hurry which ensued baffle all description;
the Shillooks were in a panic, and, imagining that
it must be all up with them, scampered off and jostled each
other in every direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NUBIAN LOGIC.</div>

<p>The propitious wind did not, however, prevent our people
from finding time to make a little <i lang="fr">détour</i> into the country,
where they had the luck to find some herdsmen who were
trying to conceal a heifer amongst the grass. There was a
report of a gun, and the beast was stretched upon the ground.
A few minutes sufficed to quarter its carcase, and the hide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and the pieces were conveyed on board. Half-a-dozen kids
and some sheep were added to the stock, and so we proceeded
on our way. In the eyes of the people such plundering is
deemed to be perfectly legitimate for various reasons: first,
because the Shillooks are heathen; secondly, because some
years before they had burnt five Nubian vessels; thirdly and
chiefly, because mutton and beef are very choice eating,
particularly after having been limited for a time to durrapap.
My tawny companions seemed to think that they knew
a fourth palliation for their proceeding, which consisted in
this, that none but themselves were capable of making a
proper use of the goods of the blacks. In the districts of
the Upper Nile, wherever the breeding of cattle is carried
on, it is a custom of the negroes never to kill an animal,
but only to consume those which die naturally; the reason
obviously being, that they look upon the possession of living
cattle as the main object of their existence. With them,
steers do the duty of guineas and napoleons; the Nubians,
therefore, jocosely affirm that they swallow the guineas,
which in the keeping of the heathen are nothing better than
so much dead capital.</p>

<p>We were not long in leaving the Shillook villages far
behind. The inhabited region seemed to recede as our boat
made its way along the water-course. The stream divided
itself into a multitude of channels, which threaded their
way amidst a maze of islands. The distant rows of acacias
on either side were the only tokens to indicate the mainland.
This was the day on which we first saw the papyrus. To me,
botanist as I was, the event elevated the day to a festival.
Here at a latitude of 9° 30´ <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> are we now first able to salute
this sire of immortal thought, which centuries ago was just
as abundant in Egypt as at present it is on the threshold of
the central deserts of Africa. I was quite lost in admiration
at the variety of production of the surface of the water, to
which the antique papyrus gave a noble finish. It strikes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
the gaze like the creation of another world, and seems to
inspire a kind of reverence: although for days and weeks I
was environed by the marvellous beauties which enrich the
flora of the Nile, my eye was never weary of the vision of
its graceful form.</p>

<p>The hindrances to our progress caused by the excessive
vegetation began now to give us some anxiety. All day
long we were bewildered not only by the multiplicity of
channels, but by masses of grass, papyrus, and ambatch,
which covered the whole stream like a carpet, and even
when they opened gave merely the semblance of being
passages. It is quite possible that the diversion of its course
to the east, which, for sixty miles the Nile here takes, may
check the progress of the stream, and be in a measure
the cause of such a strange accumulation of water-plants.
Certain it seems that neither any exceptional depth of water,
such as may occur in particular years, nor yet any general
overflow wider than usual, avails to exercise the slightest
influence upon this exuberant vegetation. Were it a coating
of ice it would split itself into fragments under the pressure
of the stream, but here is a real web of tough tangle, which
blockades the entire surface. Every here and there, indeed,
the force of the water may open a kind of rift, but not corresponding
at all with the deeper and true channel of the
stream. Such a rift is not available for any passage of the
boats. The strain of the tension, which goes on without
intermission, has such an effect in altering the position of
the weedy mass, that even the most experienced pilot is at
a loss how to steer, consequently every voyage in winter is
along a new course, and through a fresh labyrinth of tangle.
But in July, when the floods are at their highest, navigation
can be carried on along well nigh all the channels, since the
currents are not so strong, and the vessels are able to proceed
without detention to their destinations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRASS TANGLE.</div>

<p>Thick masses of little weeds float about the surface of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
water, and by forming a soft pulp, contribute an effectual
aid to bind together the masses of vegetation. Like a
cement this conglomerate of weeds fills up all the clefts
and chasms between the grass and ambatch islands, which
are formed in the back-water where the position is sheltered
from the winds and free from the influence of the current.</p>

<p>There are two plants, at a superficial glance hardly distinguishable,
which perform the largest share in the formation
of this compact web. One of them is the thin-membraned
water-fern, the <i lang="la">Azolla</i>; the other (which is quite
familiar to every visitor to the tank of the <i>Victoria regia</i>)
being the <i lang="la">Pistia</i>, which can hardly fail to recall a head of
lettuce. The sailors of the White Nile call it the “negro
tobacco,” probably with reference to the dwarfed growth of
the two kinds of tobacco in the negro lands. Besides these,
our duck-weeds (<i lang="la">Lemna</i>) and Tussieua of various sorts intertwine
themselves with the mass, and the different African
representations of our commonest water-plants play a part by
no means unimportant.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in Egypt nearly all the species of
water-plants which abound in the stream of the White Nile
are wanting entirely; whilst, on the other hand, all the
shore-shrubs, which had their native home in the neighbourhood
of the Equator, pass over the intervening districts and
there find a settlement. Even the conspicuous ambatch is, in
Egypt, not known by name; and it is quite an event when
any of the fragments of the papyrus find their way so far
north. Every bit of wood which the river carries in its
flood is collected by the inhabitants of the Nubian valley,
and not a scrap escapes the keen look-out of the people, who
are eager to compensate for their lack of firewood. At the
season when the waters are at their height, the chase after
floating wood is a daily occupation and a favourite engagement
of the boys.</p>

<p>On the 8th of February began our actual conflict with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
world of weeds. That entire day was spent in trying to
force our boats along the temporary openings. The pilots
were soon absolutely at a loss to determine by which channel
they ought to proceed. On this account two vessels were
detached from the flotilla to investigate the possibility of
making a passage in a more northerly direction. Two hundred
of our people, sailors and soldiers, were obliged to lug
with ropes for hours together to pull through one boat after
the other, while they walked along the edge of the floating
mass, which would bear whole herds of oxen, as I subsequently
had an opportunity of seeing.</p>

<p>Very singular was the spectacle of the vessels, as though
they had grown in the place where they were, in the midst
of this jungle of papyrus, fifteen feet high; whilst the
bronzed, swarthy skins of the naked Nubians contrasted
admirably with the bright green which was everywhere
around. The shrieks and shouts with which they sought to
cheer on their work could be heard miles away. The very
hippopotamuses did not seem to like it; in their alarm they
lifted their heads from the shallows in which they had
stationed themselves for respiration, and snorted till the
gurgling around was horrible. The sailors, concerned lest by
their bulk these unwieldy creatures should injure the boats—&#8203;not
an unknown occurrence—&#8203;gave vent to the full force
of their lungs. This unearthly clamour was indeed the solitary
means of defence at their command; in such a turmoil—&#8203;men
and boats in every direction—&#8203;firing a shot was not to
be thought of.</p>

 <p class="caption">THE VESSELS IN THE GRASS-BARRIER.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<div class="sidenote">EL SETT: THE GRASS-BARRIER.</div>

<p>This extraordinary grass-barrier had already been met
with at the time of Miss Tinné’s expedition in 1863; here
again in the summer of 1872 was it found, strong as ever,
offering for months its serious impediments to navigation,
and threatening to expose the crews to destitution, if their
provisions should fail. The enterprising expedition of Sir
Samuel Baker, in 1870-71, suffered repeated hindrances at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
this spot. An attempt was made to employ machinery to
penetrate the mass, but steam-boats proved to be even less
successful than the ordinary boats in making any headway.
The conflict in these waters by means of wind and steam
recalls what is not unfrequently seen in Egypt when a lot
of men try to drag a donkey through the mud.</p>

<p>In this laborious fashion we had to toil on for several days.
It was only by one of the side-arms of the blockaded mainstream
that it was possible to reach the mouth of the Gazelle
River. To this backwater the sailors give the name of
“Maia Signora,” because the access to it is stated to have
been discovered by the pilots who conducted Miss Tinné.
Ever since the formation of the grass barrier (<i>el Sett</i>) there
has been no approach to the river of Gondokoro, the Bahr-el-Gebel,
except by a long side-arm called the Giraffe River,
which is itself almost equally blocked up. Upon the whole
we were more fortunate than our predecessors of previous
years, because our journey chanced to fall during one of the
periodical seasons when the growth of the ambatch is at a
standstill. It happened therefore that of the three obstacles
which (besides the current and the shallows) are generally
to be expected, viz., grass, papyrus, and ambatch, one of
the most important did not occur. The close of our first
day’s exertion found us at night-fall on the southerly side of
an island in mid-stream, whence we witnessed a spectacle
striking in its way. Through an immense grove of acacias
seventy feet high (<i lang="la">A. verugera</i>), which were remarkable for
their resemblance to pine-trees, there gleamed, with the glare
of day, the light of huge bonfires of faggots, which the
Shillooks had kindled on the opposite bank, and which gave
to the tall trees the effect of being truly gigantic.</p>

<p>Here on the 9th we tarried, and as it was the last woody
district upon which we could reckon until we arrived at the
mouth of the Bahr-el-Arab, we set to work to repair our
broken sailyard. We were close now to the region of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Nueir: and on the steppes beyond the wood, we could see
troops of them moving backwards and forwards; but they
kept at a distance, and showed no disposition to open any
negotiations with us. Footprints and various other indications
leave no doubt but that this district is the playground
of elephants, giraffes, wild buffaloes, and hyenas. Maraboo
storks were abundant, and would often come tolerably close
to the resorts of men, but as soon as they found themselves
observed were careful to keep at a safe distance. During
our progress along the river I brought down very many of
these birds, and secured a quantity of their valuable feathers.
These I sent to Europe, and at a bazaar for the benefit of
the sick and wounded they realised a considerable sum.
Maraboo feathers fetch higher prices than ostrich feathers,
yet it is very remarkable that they are quite unknown in the
commerce of Khartoom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NUBIAN SONGS.</div>

<p>The temperature of the preceding days had been singularly
fresh, and consequently the plague of flies, from which
previous travellers had had to endure so much, did not at all
molest us. We were, however, provided on board with all the
appliances to protect ourselves from this nuisance, in case
of need. Far into the night after these days of prolonged
exertion resounded the songs of the Nubians, and the gourd-shells
of merissa beer went round amid the native strains of
Berber and Dongola. As I did not thoroughly understand
the dialect of Dongola, I continually lost the exact purport
of the words which were sung. One with the other the
Nubians often use this dialect, although they just as frequently
speak Arabic. Every now and then as they sung
I made them tell me the sense of separate sentences; my
listening to them seemed to delight them all, and I heard
them saying behind my back, “Pity that the man is not a
Mussulman, or at least a Turk, then what a capital fellow he
would be!” To which another replied, “Turk, indeed! who
ever heard of a Turk troubling himself about our songs? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Franks are worth a thousand of them!” The flattery took
its effect upon me, and I was moved at once to deliver a
regular homily to my people. Feeling like Cæsar among
the pirates, I proceeded to say, “Did you ever hear, you
rascals of cow-stealers, about those ancestors of yours, the
Ethiopians of Meroë?” “Yes, indeed,” rejoined the Nubians,
“for many and many a verse did our ancient poets compose
about them, to celebrate their virtue; and they used to declare
about the ruler of the gods (for at that time we believed
in many gods) if he couldn’t be found in heaven it was
because he was lingering amongst his darling Ethiopians
on earth. But now, we have Allah, the great Allah;
besides Allah we care for no other.”</p>

<p>“All very well;” I replied; “but where is the poet who
can sing about his love to you, incorrigible thieves as you
are? Just mind then what you are about for the future,
and try to show that you are not unworthy of your great
ancestors.”</p>

<p>The next day was again employed in unrelaxed endeavours
to penetrate the grass-bound channels. The patches of
papyrus became at once more frequent and more extensive,
and here once again, after being long missed, is found the
genuine Nile reed, the “shary” of the ancient Egyptians—&#8203;the
same as the soof of the Bible—&#8203;which always grows on
the shores of the mainland. Somewhat strangely the prevailing
river-grass in the upper waters, the <i lang="la">Vossia procera</i>,
is called in Arabic “Om-Soof,” the mother of wool. This
appellation it derives from the peculiar hairy character of its
leaf-sheaths. These have the disagreeable quality of covering
the entire bodies of those who may be at work in the grass
with a thick down of adhesive bristles. The sharpness of
these and the scratches they inflict increase the irksomeness
of the daily labour at the grass barrier. Still the great
prairies amidst which the flood pursues its course afford an
inexhaustible pasturage; cattle, sheep, and horses, all graze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
upon them, and no herbage is there that they prefer to the
“Om-Soof.” At the close of the day, we again arrived in
open water, and laid up for the night by the left bank, which
presented a wide steppe entirely bare of trees.</p>

<p>Up with the sun, with sails hoisted with a moderate breeze
in our favour, off we were on the following morning; short-lived,
however, was our propitious start. Too soon the open
water branched out into a labyrinth of channels, and the
bewildered navigators lost all clue as to the actual direction
of the stream. The projections of the green islets were
always crowned with huge clumps of papyrus, which here
grows in detached masses. It probably delights most in
quiet waters, and so does not attain to the form of a high
unbroken hedge, as on the upper banks of the Gazelle, for
here, on account of the numerous stoppages, the stream flows
through the narrow channels with extraordinary violence.
The strength of the stream often makes towing impracticable,
and the sailors often have considerable difficulty in sailing
through it to the papyrus bushes, when they want to attach
to their solid stems the ropes which are thrown out from
their boats. This was the way in which we from sheer
necessity sustained the resistance of the current. The
depth of the channel was quite sufficient in itself to allow us
to proceed, as our vessels drew only three feet of water; but
the passage had become so contracted that at sunset we
fastened ourselves to the papyrus-stems, quite despairing of
ever being able to make further progress in this direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIPPO-<br>POTAMUSES.</div>

<p>It was one of those marvellous nights when the unwonted
associations of a foreign clime seem to leave an indelible
impression on the memory of the traveller. Here were the
dazzling sparks of the glow-worm, glaring upon us like a
greeting from our far-off home, and in countless masses
glittering upon the dewy stalks of the floating prairie. In
the midst of these were fastened our boats, hemmed in as
firmly as though they were enclosed by polar ice. Loud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
was the rushing of the stream as it forced a way along its
contracted course; but louder still was the incessant splashing
of the emerging hippopotamuses, which had been driven
by the vessels, as it were, into a corner, and were at a loss,
like ourselves, how to go on or to retreat. Until daybreak
their disquietude continued, and it seemed as though their
numbers kept increasing, till there was quite a crowd of
them. Already during the afternoon they had afforded a
singular sight: whilst about half of our men were wading
in shallow water and straining at the ropes, they found that
they had entirely enclosed no less than six hippopotamuses,
whose huge flesh-coloured carcases, dappled with brown,
rose above the surface of the water in a way but rarely seen.
A cross-fire was opened upon them from several vessels, but
I could not make any use of my elephant rifle, because about
200 of our men were towing upon my line of sight. The
clumsy brutes snorted and bellowed, and rolled against each
other in their endeavours to escape; their ponderous weight
bore down the tangle of the water-growth, and the splashing
was prodigious.</p>

<p>Four days had now been consumed in this strain and
struggle; after a final and unavailing effort on the fifth
day, there seemed no alternative but to go back and make
trial of another and more northerly branch of this bewildering
canal-system. We succeeded in our retrograde movement
so far as to attain an open basin, and found that we had only
the distance of about 200 feet to get over, in order that we
might reach the spot whereat the various streams of the
Upper Nile unite. This place on the maps is distinguished
by the name of Lake No, but the sailors always call it
Mogren-el-Bohoor, <i>i.e.</i>, the mouth of the streams. The
difficulties which met us here were apparently quite hopeless.
Our boats were not only heavily laden with corn, but, formed
of the heaviest wood, their build was unusually broad and
massive. Yet heavy and unwieldy as they were there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
no alternative than literally to drag them over the grass.
By dint, however, of main force, before the day was out the
task was accomplished. The grass mass itself was lifted and
pushed in front, whilst the men turned their backs against
the sides of the boats, and pressed them on from behind. I
was the only passenger to remain on board, because being
fearful of a chill which might result in fever, I could not
venture into the water.</p>

<p>What the maps call Lake No is merely the expanded
mouth of the meeting waters. The current flowing from the
south from the Bahr-el-Gebel passes along its apparent shores,
which are projecting masses of papyrus. In order to reach
the Gazelle it is necessary to bend westwards along the
gradually narrowing lake-basin. At no season of the year is
this water otherwise than shallow; even at the time of our
retrograde voyage, when the floods were highest, we stranded
more than once. Floating islands of papyrus of considerable
extent were visible every here and there, and broke the
uniformity of the expanse.</p>

<p>The passage which leads to the Gazelle has the essential
properties of running water, although the stream itself is in
winter scarcely perceptible. The river, however, is surrounded
by such a multiplicity of backwaters and waters
remaining in old river-beds, that the united volume of such
a number of streams as I saw emptying themselves into it,
at various times, through some hundreds of miles, could not
possibly find its exit through this single channel alone.
Petherick, in 1863, at the period when the water-floods were
as low as possible, estimated the volume of waters to be
rolling on at the rate of 3042 cubic feet a second; but he
must have referred simply to the navigable channel at the
mouth, without intending to represent that the calculation
referred to the entire mass of the waters.</p>

<p>It remains still a matter of dispute which of the two
currents should be considered as the main stream. According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
to analogy, as the Sobat is related to the Blue Nile, so
the Bahr-el-Gebel is to the Bahr-el-Abiad, just as the Blue
Nile is to the Nile of Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GAZELLE.</div>

<p>One of the objects contemplated in my journey was to
show the importance of the western affluents of the Nile
which unite in the Gazelle; and I have given evidence that,
one way and another, they traverse a region of not less than
150,000 square miles. When I mention that in 1863 Speke
called the Gazelle “an unimportant branch,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and moreover
that Baker has spoken of its magnitude with great depreciation,
in reply, I might allude to another interesting fact in
geographical annals. Not only did Bruce, a hundred years
ago, suppose that he had discovered the sources of the Nile
in Abyssinia, just where a hundred years previously they
had been marked upon the Portuguese maps; but he represented
the Bahr-el-Abiad as an inconsiderable stream, which
joined the stream of his discovery at Halfaya, Khartoom at
that time being not in existence. But it is absolutely impossible
that Bruce could have returned from Sennaar to
Berber along the left bank of the Blue Nile, and could have
crossed at its mouth from the very spot where Khartoom
now stands, without being aware that close behind him there
was rolling its waters a stream as broad again as the Blue
Nile. The record of his travels does not contain one
word about the White Nile. The plain truth is that the
White Nile was overlooked and disparaged, because it
would have thrown his Blue Nile in the shade.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Ismail
Pasha was quite right in saying that every fresh African
traveller had his own private sources of the Nile; but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
my part I am not at all ashamed to confess that I have not
found them.</p>

<p>The wind was favourable, and so long as the course
maintained a north-westerly direction we made a rapid progress.
The main channel gradually contracted, however, and
deviated into many abrupt meanderings, which had to be
traversed by pushing and driving with poles. Here, too, the
apparent banks consisted of floating grass-tangle, though
further off the pasturing herds of the Dinka showed the true
position of the mainland, whilst the ridge of forest beyond
indicated the limit to which the inundations had extended.
North of the mouth of the Gazelle the boundaries of the
Shillooks and the Dinka meet each other, and the intervening
territory is inhabited by the Nueir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GHATTAS BIRD.</div>

<p>In some places amongst the grass-tangle I made an attempt
to botanize, and out of the numerous holes I fished up a
variety of most interesting plants. The Gazelle is specially
noted for the beauty of its water-lilies (<i lang="la">Nymphæa stellata</i> and
<i lang="la">N. lotus</i>). Blossoms of these, in every variety of hue—&#8203;white,
blue, and crimson—&#8203;well-nigh everywhere adorn the surface
of the water; rooted below they project their long stalks
and leaves through the apertures, like fishes, in the winter, to
catch the air through holes in the ice. Should any one make
a grasp at a blossom and fail to make good his hold, it may
happen that the entire plant will make an elastic rebound
and disappear beneath the grass. During the afternoon our
course was <abbr title="north-west">N.W.</abbr> and <abbr title="west north-west">W.N.W.</abbr>, which is the general direction
of the Gazelle throughout its lower half. The stream became
wider again, the banks continuing to be lined by an impenetrable
grass jungle. Remarkable dark-coloured water-birds
(<i lang="la">Plotus melanogaster</i>) are found in considerable numbers upon
the shores, intent upon making prey of small fishes. They
settle upon the bushes, and one may every now and then be
seen to make a sudden dive into the water, bring up a little
fish in its beak, and resume its previous perch. Amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the people of Khartoom this bird is called the “Ghattas,” a
name which invested it with a special interest to me as being
the name of my temporary protector.</p>

<p>For some few days past, just before sunset, great masses
of tiny green flies had made their appearance. Although
these were in no respect injurious, yet the buzzing they made
and the choking cough which was caused by their numbers
were anything but agreeable. Shortly after dark they
retreated, only to appear again in the early dawn. Much
more pertinacious were the spotty-legged gnats, which now
began to torment us when the nights were not cool enough
to disperse them. Everybody on board had provided himself
for protection with a sack made of calico in which he
slept, the result of which was ordinarily a temperature of
some 80° Fahr., about the same as a regular vapour-bath.
These gnats did not buzz about with so loud a noise, but
their sting was much more decided. They might not cause
such a lasting itching as some of their northern kindred, but
the knack they had of finding a way for their proboscis
through the thickest cotton till it reached one’s skin, made
it only possible to keep them off by means of mosquito-nets.
But altogether I reckoned this visitation as hardly worth the
notice of a traveller who had grown up amongst the gnats of
the teeming marshes of the north.</p>

<p>The Bahr-el-Ghazal may in some respects be compared to
the Havel as it flows between Potsdam and Brandenburg; the
two rivers are not dissimilar in their excess of floating vegetation,
composed of plants which, to a great extent, are
identical in their generic character. Frequently the breadth
is not more than enough for a single vessel, but the depth could
not be fathomed by our longest poles, and so revealed what
was the enormous volume of water concealed by the carpet of
grass for two hundred paces on either hand. What ordinarily
appears to be land assumes at high water the aspect of
an extensive lake. The general uniformity of level prevents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
any extensive range of vision; but I had only to mount the
roof of my cabin, and, by observing the distance between the
woods that skirted the prospect, I could approximately estimate
the width of the river-bed. Nowhere did it appear
to me to extend, like the valley of the Egyptian Nile, to
a breadth of eight miles; and certainly, without further evidence,
I cannot agree with former travellers, who describe
it as being a lake or marsh of which the boundaries are
unlimited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BALÆNICEPS REX.</div>

<p>Neither crocodiles nor hippopotamuses are here to be
observed. The absence of settled river-banks prohibits the
Upper Nile from being the resort of the former; the deficiency
of sand-banks would permit no life to the latter, which
therefore make good their retreat to the narrower streams of
the interior.</p>

<p>The second day of our voyage along the river brought us
to the district tenanted by the Nueir. We found them
peacefully pasturing their flocks and herds beside their huts,
and betraying nothing like fear. They had been represented
to me as an intelligent people; seeming to know what they
had to expect or to dread, they were disposed for friendly
intercourse with the Khartoom people, who, in their turn,
were not inclined to commit any act of violence upon their
territory. Two years and a half later, at the period of our
return, all this was unfortunately changed, and landing was
impossible.</p>

<p>Most of the Nueir villages lie on a spot where the Gazelle
makes a bend from a north-east to a south-westerly direction.
As we were making our way past the enclosures which
lie on either side of the stream, my attention was arrested by
the sight of a number of some of the most remarkable birds
that are found in Africa. Strutting along the bank, they
were employing their broad bills to grope in the slimy
margins of the stream for fish. The bird was the <i lang="la">Balæniceps
Rex</i>, a curiosity of the rarest kind, known amongst the
sailors as the Abu-Markoob (or slipper-shape), a name derived
from the peculiar form of its beak. It scientific name is due
to the disproportionate magnitude of its head. Before 1850
no skins of this bird had been conveyed to Europe; and it
appeared unaccountable to naturalists how a bird of such
size, not less than four feet high, and of a shape so remarkable,
should hitherto have remained unknown; they were
not aware that its habitat is limited to a narrow range, which
it does not quit. Except by the Gazelle and in the central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
district of the Bahr-el-Gebel, the Balæniceps has never been
known to breed.</p>

<p>The first that appeared I was fortunate enough to hit with
a rifle ball, which wounded it in its back, and brought it
down: we measured its wings, and found them to be more
than six feet across. Another was struck, but although it
was pursued by an active party of Nubians, it effected an
escape. As generally observed, the bird is solitary, and sits
in retired spots; its broad beak reclines upon its crop,
and it stands upon the low ground very much as it is
represented in the accompanying illustration: it rarely
occupies the ant-hills which every here and there rise
some feet above the vegetation. The great head of the
bird rises over the tall blades of grass and ever betrays
its position. Its general structure would class it between
a pelican and a heron, whilst its legs resemble those of a
maraboo; it snaps with its beak, and can make a clattering
noise like the stork. This Balæniceps would seem to furnish
a proof that not everything in nature is perfectly adapted
to its end, for when the birds are full grown, they never
have their beaks symmetrical. The upper part does not correspond
with the lower; the two members fall apart, and,
like an old woman’s jaws, go all awry. The colour of their
plumage in winter is a dingy light brown, their wings are
black, and they seem to fly with difficulty, carrying their ungraceful
heads upon their necks at full stretch, like a heron.
They build in the rainy season, always close to the open
water, forming their great nests of ambatch-stalks.</p>

<p>At the next groups of huts we made a stop, and did some
bartering with the Nueir, who brought sheep and goats for
exchange. Here, in the heart of the Nueir population, in a
district called Nyeng, we fixed our quarters until the 16th. I
made use of the time to spend the whole day in my ambatch-canoe,
collecting the water-plants from the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NUEIR.</div>

<p>The Nueir are a warlike tribe, somewhat formidable to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Dinka. They occupy a territory by the mouths of the two
tributaries of the White Nile, and are evidently hemmed in
by hostile neighbours. In most of their habits they resemble
alike the Shillooks and the Dinka, although in their dialect
they differ from both. The pasturage of herds is their chief
pursuit. The traveller who would depict their peculiarities
must necessarily repeat much of what he has already recorded
about the other tribes. With regard to apparel it will
suffice to say that the men go absolutely naked, the women
are modestly girded, and the girls wear an apron formed of
a fringe of grass. Their hair is very frequently dyed of a
tawny-red hue by being bound up for a fortnight in a compo
of ashes and cow-dung; but occasionally it is cut quite short.
Some of them weave cotton threads into a kind of peruke,
which they stain with red ochre, and use for decoration
where natural locks are not abundant. Their huts resemble
those of the Dinka; always clean, the dwellings are surrounded
by a trampled floor; the sleeping-place inside is
formed of ashes of cow-dung, burnt perfectly white, and is
warmer and better than any mosquito-net.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the world could a better illustration be
afforded of the remarkable law of Nature which provides
that similar conditions of existence should produce corresponding
types amongst all ranks of animal creation. It does
not admit of a doubt that men and beasts in many districts
of which the natural features are in marked contrast to the
surrounding parts do exhibit singular coincidences, and that
they do display a certain agreement in their tendencies. The
confirmation of this resemblance which is offered by the
Shillooks, the Nueir, and the Dinka is very complete; these
tribes, stationed on the low marshy flats which adjoin the
river, are altogether different in habit to those which dwell
among the crags and rocks of the interior. “They give the
impression,” says my predecessor Heuglin, “that amongst
men they hold very much the same place that flamingoes, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
birds, hold with reference to the rest of the feathered race;”
and he is right. The dwellers in these marsh-lands would
probably have a web between their toes were it not compensated
by the flatness of their feet and the unusual prolongation
of the heel. Another remarkable similarity is the way in
which, like the birds of the marshes, they are accustomed for
an hour at a time to stand motionless on one leg, supporting
the other above the knee. Their leisurely long stride
over the rushes is only to be compared to that of a stork.
Lean and lanky limbs, a long, thin neck on which rests
a small and narrow head, give a finishing touch to the
resemblance.</p>

<p>Leaving the last dwellings of the Nueir behind us, we
arrived on the following day at the first wood which is to be
observed on the banks of the Gazelle. Ant-hills of more than
ten feet high are here scattered in every direction, and alone
break the universal levelness of the plain. They are not unfrequently
found in the heart of a thicket, because originally
the stem of a tree served as the central axis of the earthy
structure. Dead and withered though this had been, it
sprouted out afresh from the roots, provided that these had
been uninjured by the passages of the ants. Vestiges of the
floods are traceable upon them, and show that the average
difference between the highest and lowest level of the water
is from three to four feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALONG THE GAZELLE.</div>

<p>The river wends its way through charming wood-scenery,
meandering amidst groves gay with the red bindweed
(<i lang="la">Ipomæa</i>), amidst which now and then a tall tamarind uprears
itself. Here I met with a fresh representative of the flora
of Central Africa in the tree-like Euphorbia with its arms
outspread like candelabras. This can be distinguished from
the Euphorbia of the Abyssinian highlands, mentioned in
Chapter I., by the involved confusion of its branches. Its
eccentric shapes would seem to fill a place in Africa which in
America is supplied by the order of the Cactaceæ; it also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
serves like the Mexican Cereus for the enclosure of estates,
as slips taken from its branches readily take root in the
ground. The sportsman could here reckon on a good bag,
for the widow-ducks which swarmed upon the papyrus were
brought down at every shot, and were serviceable for the
table. Our people were all expert swimmers, and they
continually fished out of the stream the birds which were
struck, while their sport in no way ever hindered the progress
of our craft.</p>

<p>The wind next day was not propitious, and the boats were
obliged to stay beside a grass tangle by the bank. I made
use of the detention to enjoy a little fishing for water-plants.
The water-lilies surpassed all description, and would adorn
any Victoria-house. Unfortunately I could not succeed in
transferring to this region the queen of the waters. The
<i lang="la">Victoria regia</i> seed, which I had brought for the purpose in
pots, would never germinate; perhaps, although it was preserved
in water, the heat of my cabin during my voyage was
too great and destroyed its vitality. I can only boast of
having naturalised in this district of Central Africa two
plants as representatives of culture in Europe—&#8203;the sun-flower
and the tomato. The river, which is ordinarily about 300 feet
wide, abounds in thick masses of potamogeton, trapa, and
yellow ottelia. The seeds of this last plant much resemble
the sesamum, growing like the seeds of the Nymphæa in a
slimy gelatinous mass; they are collected by the natives, and,
after being dried, are pounded down into a sort of meal,
which the sailors of Khartoom assured me was a wholesome
and excellent remedy for indigestion. It surprised me very
much to learn that the eatableness of the water-nut (<i lang="la">Trapa</i>)
was unknown to the Dinka, although it grew in such abundance
on the river.</p>

<p>We landed, towards evening, close below the mouth of the
Bahr-el-Arab in a forest of lofty trees, where the West
African <i lang="la">Stephegyne</i> appears to find its extreme eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
limit. The wood of this species of Rubiaceæ is somewhat
soft and light, but its branches make masts for the boats of a
strength and straightness unequalled by any other growth
in these countries, where wood adapted for erections of any
sort is so notably scarce.</p>

<p>The Gazelle, at the place where the Bahr-el-Arab empties
itself, has a width of about 1000 feet. This mouth is itself
not much less, but just above the mouth the condition of
the Gazelle is so different that it must be evident to every
sailor that the Bahr-el-Arab plays a very important part in
contributing to the entire system.</p>

<p>What the sailors mean by the Bahr-el-Ghazal is really
only the channel as far as they navigate it; to them it is
not a stream, in a hydrographical sense, such as either the
Bahr-el-Arab or the Bahr-el-Dyoor. It is only at the mouth
of the Bahr-el-Arab that there first appears a measurable
current, and the fairway, which up to that point is not above
15 feet deep, is subsequently never less than twice that
depth. After getting every information I could in the remotest
west, I come to the conclusion that the Bahr-el-Arab
is the main stream. Even at a distance of 300 miles above
its mouth it is found throughout the year as a stream which
cannot be forded, but must be crossed in boats, whilst the
Bahr-el-Dyoor cannot be traced at all at so great a distance
from its union with the Nile. The plains through which
the Gazelle flows are too level to allow of any recognition
at first sight of the true limits of the territory subject to its
inundations. Any one, however, who is familiar with the
character of the vegetation of the country, will easily detect
symptoms from which he could form a tolerably correct
opinion. Accordingly, on my return journey in 1871, I
gathered ample evidence to satisfy myself that the Gazelle,
associated as it is with the Bahr-el-Arab and the Bahr-el-Dyoor,
is a river just as truly as either of the others. The
fall of the water in the Gazelle is only produced by the torrent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
driven from the south and west, and may hardly admit
of being estimated, since the entire difference measured
between Khartoom and the Meshera (the termination of
the navigable course) does not altogether amount to 100
feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STREAM OF THE GAZELLE.</div>

<p>An important change in the scenery of the shores supervenes
upon a further progress. The lake-like surface of the
water gives to the Bahr-el-Ghazal the semblance at first
sight of being merely an extensive backwater. That just
above the mouth of a stream so considerable as the Bahr-el-Arab
there should be this abundance of water at the very
time of the year when it is at its lowest ebb, is a circumstance
which cannot fail to confirm the supposition which I
entertained when I entered the Gazelle: I was certain that
the narrow channel through which we travelled in the district
of the Nueir could not possibly be the entire river;
and there surely must exist to the north of the river other
not inconsiderable arms, which are inaccessible on account
of the denseness of the river grass.</p>

<p>Unhindered by any material obstacles, our course now
lay between floating islands, which were partly adorned with
variegated blossoms, and partly loaded with a luxuriant
growth of splendid ferns. The poles sufficed to keep the
boats from the floating vegetation, the masses of which were
as unyielding as though they had been sheets of ice. It
was evident by the motion of these masses, that the current,
though it flowed languidly, had a continued progress towards
the east. The river only varies in depth from about 8 to 14
feet. The bed presents the appearance of a meadow, in
which little bright tortoises enjoy their pasture. This submerged
sward is composed exclusively of the Ethiopian vallisneria,
of which the female blossoms, affixed to spiral
peduncles, rise from a fathom deep to the surface of the
stream, their coiling stalks extending far and wide. Very
wonderful is this plant in its sexual development; its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
northern sisters haunt the waters of the Po and of the Rhone,
and have furnished a theme for the admiration of the poet.</p>

<p>Far away, on either side, beyond the flooded borders of
the grassy river-bed could be discerned, at a distance of a
league or two, large tracts of forest land; and between the
river and the line of woods which stretched to the horizon
there could be observed the cumbrous shapes of elephants
going to and fro, and demonstrating that there at least the
land was firm.</p>

<p>The channel, which we rapidly passed along under favourable
breezes, became continually broader, and the nearer
we approached the river source, the more the banks seemed
to recede from each other. The sight of men, fishing out
of canoes formed by a couple of hollow stems being fastened
together, made us aware that we were approaching the dwellings
of the Dinka, and soon after we came upon the enclosures
for cattle surrounded by low thatch huts upon the left
bank. Sailing on towards the south and south-east, we
approximated to the limit of our voyage. A great cracking
up in the air revealed to us that the sailyard had once more
broken, so that it was only by main force, by pushing and
pulling, that we managed to reach a large Dinka village,
which lay on the west, almost at the extremity of the stream.
Here was the <i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>, to which the Dinka have given the
name of the Kyt. We had quite recently passed the mouth
of the Dyoor, which appears to separate into several streams;
but if my attention had not been called to this circumstance
by the Reis, I should certainly never have observed it, on
account of the uniform features of that watery region. In
our delight at having so quickly, and without misadventure,
accomplished our passage up the Gazelle, we had a night of
feasting and merry-making.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MESHERA ON THE GAZELLE.</div>

<p>The remainder of the journey was soon completed, and in
the early morning hours of the 22nd of February we found
ourselves at the Meshera, the landing-place of all who resort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
to the Gazelle. This place is marked in the maps as Port
Rek, called so from the Rek, a section of the Dinka. These
Rek people were the first allies among the natives that the
new comers had acquired, and they had been accustomed
to provide them with bearers long before the Khartoom
merchants had established any settlements in the interior.
Deducting the days on which we had not proceeded, our
boats had taken thirty days in going from Khartoom to the
Meshera. I had been anxious to make a good investigation
of the river banks; otherwise the voyage might easily be
accomplished in twenty days.</p>

<p>Above the mouth of the Dyoor, so difficult of access, the
deep channel is continued for a space of sixteen miles, when
it forms the <i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i> which I have mentioned: there is not
the least current when the waters are all at their height;
but in March and April there may at some places be observed
a retrograde motion of the stream. It is manifestly an
ancient bed of the Dyoor, or of some river which in the
lapse of time has changed its course. It is not easy to
explain it, but the stream seemed to me, as I think I could
farther demonstrate, the navigable overflow of some inland
liman, that is, the receptacle of a number of considerable
rivulets meeting together, something like what the delta of
the Canton river would be, if it could be levelled, filled up,
and carried away inland. The uniform depth of the channel
might seem to originate in some freak in the conformation
of the ground, or of the masses of vegetation, which are
irregularly scattered about; but really it is only an indication
of a condition of things long passed away, when the
mainstream flowed through better defined and more contracted
borders.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment review the impressions we have
gained. The volume of water brought by the Gazelle to
swell the Nile is still an unsolved problem. In the contention
as to which stream is entitled to rank as first-born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
among the children of the great river god, the Bahr-el-Ghazal
has apparently a claim in every way as valid as the
Bahr-el-Gebel. In truth, it would appear to stand in the
same relation to the Bahr-el-Gebel as the White Nile does
to the Blue. At the season when the waters are highest,
the inundations of the Gazelle spread over a very wide territory;
about March, the time of year when they are lowest,
the river settles down, in its upper section, into a number of
vast pools of nearly stagnant water, whilst its lower portion
runs off into divers narrow and sluggish channels. These
channels, overgrown as they look with massy vegetation,
conceal beneath (either in their open depth, or mingled with
the unfathomable abyss of mud) such volumes of water as
defy our reckoning. The Gazelle then it is which gives
to the White Nile a sufficient impetus to roll its waters
onward; subsequently the Bahr-el-Gebel finds its way and
contributes a more powerful element to the progress of the
stream. It must all along be borne in mind that there are
besides two other streams, the Dyoor and the Bahr-el-Arab,
each of them more important than any tributary of the
Bahr-el-Gebel; and these bring in their own influence.
To estimate aright the true relation of all these various
tributaries is ever opening up the old question in a new
light.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KYT.</div>

<p>The ramifications above the mouth of the Bahr-el-Arab are
very complicated, and must be very imperfectly traced on our
present maps. The map issued by Lejean has many details,
but must be accepted with caution, and requires us to remember
that paper is patient of error as well as of truth. Whoever
has traversed the lakes (so to call them) to the west of
the Bahr-el-Arab, has, almost immediately beyond the mouth
of the Dyoor, come upon the winding channel known as “the
Kyt.” The shores of the Kyt are firm; there are detached
groups of papyrus driven by the wind sometimes to its one
bank, and sometimes to the other: its waters rise and fall, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
have no other apparent motion; it widens at its extremity into
a basin of papyrus, which was now open, but which in 1863
was entirely choked by ambatch. Heuglin, at that date, discerned,
as he thought, in the dwindled and distorted stems
a prognostication of an approaching disappearance of the
ambatch; and from 1869 to 1871 there was no trace of it,
Various openings are made by the water towards the west
among the masses of papyrus, which enclose a labyrinth of
little wooded islets.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> One of these islands is the resting-place
for the boats, and close at hand the voyagers establish
their temporary camp. Being surrounded on every side by
the water, all is secure from any hostile attack. The regular
landing-place is on the southern shore of the basin, and
thence commence the expeditions to the interior.</p>

<p>Such is the channel which, from the times of the earliest
explorers, which appear to extend from the date of Nero’s
centurions, mentioned by Seneca, up to the mercantile enterprises
and voyages of discoveries of the last ten years, has
always brought boats to that <i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>, called by the Nubian
sailors their Meshera. The first boat, which actually entered
the Gazelle, was that of a Khartoom merchant, named
Habeshy, in 1854; two years later followed Consul Petherick,
the first to open mercantile transactions with the tribes resident
in these remote regions.</p>

<p>At that time, when nothing was known either of the Dyoor
or of the Bahr-el-Arab, it must have been no small surprise
to the first explorers to see a stream so large suddenly end
amongst a labyrinth of small islands, without any navigable
affluent. Only by the help of a native pilot was such a discovery
possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MALARIOUS ATMOSPHERE.</div>

<p>I was compelled to linger out the remainder of February
and the greater part of March in camp upon the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
island, pending the arrival of the bearers who were to help
me onwards to Ghattas’s Seriba. I was happy in escaping
any ill effects such as might be dreaded from a protracted
residence by this unhealthy river. I attributed my immunity
in great measure to the precautionary use of quinine.
Although by my daily occupations, botanising in swamps
and continually wading amongst papyrus clumps, I had been
more exposed to malaria than many others, I experienced no
sickness. I swallowed every day, in three doses, eight or nine
grains of quinine, enclosed for that purpose in gelatine capsules;
this method is to be strongly recommended to every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
traveller, since the intense bitterness of the medicine taken
in its undisguised form may excite a degree of nausea which,
I can well believe, may contribute its part to a liability to
fever. This treatment I continued, without its having any
ill effect upon my constitution, until I could dispense with it
in the purer air of the interior. I suppose, since this is not
an universal experience, that the effects of the alkaloids may
vary with different patients, and therefore it would be well
for every one first to test the susceptibility of his individual
constitution.</p>

<p>It is only too well known how many victims this
treacherous climate has already claimed; it may without
exaggeration be maintained, that half the travellers who
have ventured into the swamps have succumbed to fever.
The highest mortality was in the settlements of the Austrian
mission in Gondokoro and St. Cross, now long since abandoned.
Miss Tinné’s expedition of 1863 suffered the loss of
five out of its nine European members, among them my
unfortunate predecessor in the botanical investigation of this
district, Dr. Steudner, who died suddenly quite at the beginning
of the journey. Heuglin, too, lost the greater part of his
valuable time in continual relapses of fever. The foundations
of these miserable attacks had probably been laid in
the miasma, of which the traveller had inhaled the poison
during a protracted sojourn in the Meshera. The latest
Job’s comfort, which had most unnerved me, had come just
as I was embarking at Trieste. The French Geographical
Society had, a few months previously, sent out Le Saint, a
naval officer, on a voyage of discovery, having for its object
the same district as myself, viz., the Niam-niam countries.
His outward journey had been much lengthened by the
grass obstruction in the Giraffe stream, and he died before he
entered the country in which his more extended wanderings
were designed to commence.</p>

<p>Before quitting the Meshera (the only landing-place for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
expeditions starting from the Gazelle) I will make a few
observations on the natural character, scenery, and inhabitants
of the region of this unique island world.</p>

<p>The Meshera had been reached by eighteen different
boats belonging to Khartoom merchants, and these now lay,
half-buried in mud and clay, firmly wedged in the jungle
of papyrus. Every new comer could only by great exertions
procure a fresh resting-place. For that purpose they proceeded
in the following way: they backed their boat a
little into the open water, and anchored; then a rope was
fastened to a strong mass of papyrus-roots, which it towed
with its loosened clods attached into open water, until the
breeze carried over the entire floating mass to the opposite
side of the basin. Thus was obtained one artificial Delos
after another. The access to the bank is, however, still left
blocked up by the compact border of papyrus thus conveyed
across. By means of fire and hatchet avenues are then
opened, and the long roots of papyrus are piled upon the
elastic sward of its stubble until an available pathway is
complete.</p>

<p>Most of the islands are adorned by graceful masses of
bushes and by light groves of the larger trees, but the
hatchet of strangers every year is altering this condition of
things. In spite of all the uniformity of the tall papyrus
bushes, and notwithstanding the burnt and dry appearance
of the steppe-grasses, there is no lack, even in the mild
winter of this little island-world, of the charms of scenery.
The dark crowns of the evergreen tamarind stand out in
sharp outline against the bare rugged branches of the acacias
in their grey winter garb, between which the eccentric
shapes of the candelabra-euphorbiæ, closely interlaced,
bound the horizon in every direction, and form, as often as
the eye wanders over the neighbouring islands, a fine gradation
of endless shades of colour. This is especially noticeable
in the early morning, when at sunrise a heavy mist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
hangs over the damp flats, and sometimes here, sometimes
there, sets limits to the prospect, in a way that would lend
enchantment to any scenery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SECURITY IN THE MESHERA.</div>

<p>Protected by the endless ramifications of the marshes
against any attacks of dangerous quadrupeds from the
mainland, the sojourner here had only the most determined
of all depredators to fear, namely, man himself. But even
this fear was not really great. Nowhere on the face of the
earth is a country more surrendered to robbery and lawlessness
than this district of Africa; but still, as ever, one form
of mischief balances another: man is a match for man; and
so it results that the stranger may find repose and security
here as much as elsewhere. The natives, who occupy the
entire land in a wide circumference from the Meshera,
form a portion of the great Dinka family, whose extreme
outposts extend eastwards towards the Egyptian borders
of Upper Sennaar, and whose tribes are counted by the
hundred.</p>

<p>One of the most influential personages of the neighbouring
race of the Lao was a woman, already advanced in years, of
the name of Shol. She played an important part as a sort
of chief in the Meshera, her riches, according to the old
patriarchal fashion, consisting of cattle. As wealthy as
cattle could make her, she would long since have been a
prey to the Nubians, who carry on their ravages principally
in those regions, if it had not chanced that the intruders
needed her for a friend. They required a convenient and
secure landing-place, and the paramount necessity of having
this induced them to consider plunder as a secondary matter.
They provided in this way, that single boats, even after all
others had taken their departure, could safely remain in the
Meshera throughout the rainy season without incurring any
risk from the natives. The boatmen accordingly respect the
bank of the river which is the resort of Shol’s herds; whilst
Shol, on her part, uses all her influence to retain her tribe on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
friendly terms with the strangers. The smallest conflict might
involve the entire loss of her property.</p>

<p>The old Shol did not delay, but the very first day came to
my boat to visit me. On account of the colour of my skin,
the Nubians had told her that I was a brother of the Sigñora
(Miss Tinné). My pen fails in any attempt to depict
her repulsiveness. Her naked negro skin was leathery,
coarse, and wrinkled; her figure was tottering and knocked-kneed;
she was utterly toothless; her meagre hair hung in
greasy locks; round her loins she had a greasy slip of sheepskin,
the border of which was tricked out with white beads
and iron rings; on her wrists and ankles she had almost an
arsenal of metal, links of iron, brass, and copper, strong
enough to detain a prisoner in his cell; about her neck were
hanging chains of iron, strips of leather, strings of wooden balls,
and heaven knows what lumber more. Such was old Shol.</p>

<p>A soldier, who had formerly been a Dinka slave, acted as
interpreter. For the purpose of impressing me with a due
sense of the honour of the visit and in the hope of getting
a present, he began to extol Shol and to enlarge upon the
multitude of her cattle. All the sheep-farms, of which the
smoke rose so hospitably to the stranger, were hers; hers
were all the bullock runs along the river banks; the murahs
which extended in every direction of the compass without
exception, were hers; she had at least 30,000 head of cattle;
in addition to which I could form no conception of the iron
and copper rings and chains which filled her stores.</p>

<p>After this introduction the conversation turned upon Miss
Tinné, who remained fresh upon the memory of all. Her
liberality in making presents of beads had secured her a
fame like Schiller’s “Mädchen aus der Fremde,” the spring,
who brought a gift for every one. The old Shol could not
refrain from expressing her surprise that Miss Tinné should
be unmarried; as an African she could not comprehend
how a lady that was rich could be without a husband.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
<div class="sidenote">THE OLD SHOL.</div>

<p>Very strange were the domestic and family relationships
of Shol when considered in contrast with her public position,
her present influence, and her excessive wealth. After the
death of her first husband she had become the wife of his
son by a previous marriage. She had thus raised this man,
who was younger than herself, to the rank of prince consort.
His name was Kurdyook. I had a visit from him on the
following day. From his intercourse with the traders he
could speak Arabic intelligibly. Like the rest, he was loud
in his praises of Miss Tinné, and in her honour he had called
the child of one of his concubines “the Sigñora.” Plainly
there was a longing after the culture of European refinement,
and let us hope that it will not stop at the name.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br>
 <img src="images/i_133.jpg"
 alt="The old Shol">
 <p class="caption">The old Shol.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Of course, in comparison with his wife, he was quite destitute
of lands; he was a mere cypher as far as any influence on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the tribe was concerned, but yet he exercised a terror over
Shol, which, under the circumstances, was quite incredible.
He was accustomed to chastise this dame, who was at once
his stepmother and his spouse, and to act towards her in the
most brutal manner, although she was herself in the habit,
perchance as a token of her dignity, of carrying in her hand
several knotted thongs like a cat-o’-nine-tails.</p>

<p>With rambles in the neighbourhood and in receiving a
succession of visitors, I found the days pass pleasantly away.
On the mainland towards the north there were several more
important villages, composed of permanent dwellings and
fixed enclosures for oxen. To these I constantly resorted,
and the concourse of so many men coming out of curiosity to
look at me, entertained me very much. Failure alike both of
water and food during the dry season had driven old Shol
herself to one of the islands adjacent to the landing-place;
here in some wretched huts not far from our boats she had
taken up her residence in the midst of a quantity of her
cattle. I occasionally paid her a visit, for the purpose of
penetrating to the mysteries of her dairy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTERCHANGE OF PRESENTS.</div>

<p>On the 26th of February the old queen came to the tent
which I occupied on the island, having been informed that
the presents designed for her majesty there awaited her. On
this occasion she had a costume somewhat different. She
had made a fresh selection of her paraphernalia from her
iron rings and chains, and so arrayed herself anew. I had
prepared everything for a stately reception, as I was anxious
to leave behind me an impression as favourable as Miss Tinné.
There were beads as large as eggs, such as never before were
seen in this country; there were marbles of green and blue
from the Oriental plains: she was told they were for her.
Next there were chains of steel; these, too, were hers: then
that majestic chair of plaited straw; she could scarcely believe
that she was to have it for her throne. But the crowning
charm of all was an immense bronze medal, with a chain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
plated gold, which she could hang about her neck; it was
in fact, a commemoration of a German professor’s jubilee,
with the Emperor’s likeness upon it; but no one can conceive
the admiration it excited. She was really touched,
and the sailors and soldiers seemed to like the medal as
much as she did. The gifts which were made to me in return
consisted of a calabash full of butter, a goat, a sheep, and a
splendid bull of a peculiar breed, without horns.</p>

<p>The most remarkable plant amongst the islands of the
Meshera is a climbing passion-flower—&#8203;the <i lang="la">Adenia venenata</i>,
the bright green leaves of which are applied by the natives
of Central Africa for the purpose of drawing blisters. These
leaves have, however, a poisonous property, which has proved
fatal to camels. Camels have but a feeble faculty of smelling,
and eat freely of whatever looks green, so that all
attempts to acclimatise them here have been without success.
It is the same plant which deprived Sir Samuel Baker of his
pack-ass in Latuka. The most noticeable thing about the
plant is the large development of its stem, which grows half
under the soil, and projects with a strange protuberance
some cubic feet in content. At the end of this the stem
breaks out into a number of long climbing stalks, which
mount upwards to a considerable height. One example of
these stems I packed in linen and sent to Berlin, where, after
a period of ten months, it was found to retain its vitality,
and in a palm-house soon developed a number of young
shoots.</p>

<p>The waters furnished a variety of fishes; amongst these
few were more frequently seen than a sort of harness fish
(<i lang="la">Polypterus bichir</i>), of which a representation will be given
in a later chapter. But the creature which most particularly
arrested my attention was the salamander-like fish of Gambia
(<i lang="la">Lepidosiren</i>), which, with its four slim feet projecting from
its fish-like form, had a mouth like that of a shark. I saw
specimens between three and four feet long. Its flabby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
slimy flesh is disgusting to the Nubians, although Sir Samuel
Baker, who found the same species in the Albert Nyanza,
could not sufficiently praise its flavour. The whole family
of the Siluridæ is here represented as much as in other
sections of the Nile. Many of them share with the fish-salamander
the practice of burying themselves in the bank, that
they may await in the dry the rising of the stream; in the
same way as an eel they can wriggle themselves through
the soil, and even make a way over the dry ground.</p>

<p>Considering the circumscribed limits of land, the feathered
race were found in great variety. I saw at least sixty kinds
of birds upon the four or five islands which were nearest us.
Conspicuous above all was the graceful rail (<i lang="la">Parra africana</i>),
with its spreading claws and wiry legs stalking proudly, as if
on land, upon a carpet of water-lily leaves. And not unheard
were the familiar notes of our own home birds. Sparrows
innumerable thronged about the papyrus plants, on which
they settled for their evening roost. All this, however, is
but the old story of ornithological travellers who have been
before me, and hardly needs to be repeated here.</p>

Arrival at Ghattas’s chief Seriba.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not until the eighteenth day of our sojourn in the
Meshera that Ghattas’s second boat arrived, conveying
the remainder of the newly-enlisted mercenaries and a year’s
provisions for the Seriba. The agent on board was commissioned
to procure for me from the interior whatever porters
were requisite for my progress. The shortest possible time
that must elapse before he could get to the Seriba and back
was eleven days; punctually at the end of that period he
returned, and placed at my disposal seventy bearers. Thus
fortunately I had time enough and to spare before the commencement
of the rainy season to start for the interior.</p>

<p>By the 25th of March all arrangements for setting out
were complete, and we were ready to turn our backs upon the
damp air of the swamps with its nightly plague of flies.</p>

<p>Several smaller companies having joined Ghattas’s expedition,
the number of our caravan was a little under five
hundred. Of these the armed men alone amounted to nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
two hundred; marching in single file they formed a long
column, and constituted a force with which we might have
crossed the largest State of Central Africa unmolested. Our
course for six days would be through a notoriously hostile
country, so that this protection was quite necessary; but the
caravan, extending fully half a mile, was of a magnitude to
require great order and circumspection. Each division had
its banner, and to each was appointed its proper place in the
procession. The different companies of the Khartoom merchants
were distinguished by the colour of their banners, all
emblazoned by the star and crescent of Islam. Instead of
this, Ghattas, as a Christian, had a white flag, on which were
worked the crescent and a St. Andrew’s cross. This compromise
between the crescent and the true cross did not,
however, exclude certain passages from the Koran, relating
to the conquest of unbelievers, and which could not be permitted
to be wanting on any Khartoom banner. The handsome
flag of my own boat was lying wrapped away in a box.
I confess I had no desire to make a display of it among
savages, and in a region where its meaning could not be
comprehended; but even if I had wished to exhibit it, I
subsequently discovered that any attempt to do so would
have been quite a failure. No Nubians would on any account
have followed a flag which did not bear the crescent and the
passages from the Koran. The boats on the Nile, it is true,
when they carry or belong to Europeans, do not despise the
European colours; but in the heart of the negro country,
where no Egyptian authority exists, it is different, and consequently
all European flags are worthless. The banner of
Islam is to them a talisman, and they would consider it as
sacrilege to replace it by the banner of any Christian country.
Even the trading expeditions conducted by European merchants
from Khartoom have conformed to this rule, and I
have myself witnessed the flag waving on the Rohl River at
the last settlement maintained by the brothers Poncet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSPORT OF BAGGAGE.</div>

<p>To a naturalist on his travels, the employment of men as
a means of transport appears the perfection of convenience.
Apart from the despatch and order in starting, and the regular
continuous progress, he enjoys the incalculable advantage
of being able to reach his baggage at any moment, and to
open and close again without loss of time any particular
package. Any one who has ever experienced the particular
annoyances of camel-transport will be quite aware of
the comparative comfort of this mode of proceeding. A few
asses accompanied the caravan, and the governor of Ghattas’s
Seriba had been courteous enough to send me his own
saddle-ass, but I preferred to trust myself to my own legs.
Riding a badly-saddled donkey is always infinitely more
fatiguing to me than any exertion which may be requisite
to keep up with the forced marches of the light-footed
Nubians; besides, I had other objects in view than mere
progress: I wished to observe and take notes of anything
that came in my way, and to collect plants and whatever
else might be of interest. Thus entirely on foot I began the
wanderings which for two years and three months I pursued
over a distance of more than 2000 miles. Neither camels
nor asses, mules nor horses, teams of oxen nor palanquin-bearers
contributed their aid. The only animal available,
by the help of which Central Africa could be opened to civilisation,
is exterminated by fire and sword; the elephant is
destroyed mainly for the purpose of procuring for civilised
nations an article wherewith to manufacture toys and ornaments,
and Europeans still persevere in setting the savages
a pernicious example in this respect.</p>

<p>There is sufficient evidence to show that the African elephant,
which at the present time appears to surpass the
Indian species as much in wild ferocity as in size, was formerly
tamed and trained in the same way as the elephant in
India. Medals have come down to us which portray the
considerable differences between the two species. They show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the immense size of the ear of the African elephant, and
prove beyond a doubt that it was once employed as a domestic
animal. The state of torpor to which, since the fall of
the Roman Empire, all the nations of the northern part of
Africa have been reduced, is sufficient explanation why the
worth of this animal should have been suffered to fall into
oblivion. The elephant takes as long as a man to grow to
maturity, and it could hardly be expected of the Arabs that
they should undertake the tedious task of its training; and
certainly it could not be expected of Turks, who have hardly
patience to wait for the fruits of one year’s growth, and who
would like the world to have been made so that they could
pick up their guineas already coined on the mountains. It
would be no unfortunate event for Africa if some of the
European philanthropists, who now squander their homœpathic
charities on the welfare of the negroes, were to turn
their sympathy a little to the pitiable lot which has befallen
the elephant. The testimony of Burton in his ‘Nile Basin’
is, that not only might elephants be made useful to man, but
that they appear to possess an instinct which is quite a match
for the reason not only of the natives of Africa, but of some
other of the bipeds who visit its inhospitable shores.</p>

<p>Extremely toilsome, I must own, were the first few hours
of the march. After being for months limited to the boat’s
deck and to short excursions from my little island, I now
found myself forced to keep up with the sharp pace of the
negroes, which would be a matter of difficulty to any one but
a member of the Alpine Club. Towards evening, after a two
hours’ march, we made our first halt in Shol’s village. Near
the huts some giant <a id="chg3"></a>Kigelia, in full flower, displayed their
purple tulip-like blossoms; they still stand as landmarks on
the spot, although the old Shol has gone to her rest and the
last fragments of her burnt huts have vanished. This Kigelia
is common throughout Africa, and is distinguished for its
remarkable fruit, two feet long, which hangs from the boughs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
like a string of sausages. The leaf is somewhat similar to
our walnut, and in its <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> the tree may bear comparison
with a majestic oak. Trees of such marked peculiarity
cannot do otherwise than make an impression on the
memory of every traveller in equatorial Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACROSS THE DINKA LAND.</div>

<p>Shol had come expressly from her island to take leave of
us, and to offer her hospitality to the caravan. Our course
now lay in a tolerably straight <abbr title="south south-west">S.S.W.</abbr> direction across the
western district of the extensive territory of the unsubdued
Dinka. We rested occasionally in the deserted villages and
amidst the empty cattle-pens belonging to the natives, who
made their escape as we advanced. By their continual cattle-stealing,
the Nubians have caused all the Dinka tribes to
consider foreign interlopers as their bitter enemies; the intercourse,
therefore, with the settlements in the Bongo and
Dyoor countries, which are separated from the river by the
Dinka district, can only be maintained at the expense of
keeping an adequate number of armed men to protect the
porters. Agriculture, although it is carried on to a certain
extent, is quite a secondary consideration. The Dinka often
possess large quantities of sheep and goats, but principally
they are breeders of cattle. The number of cattle in the
country is astounding, and seems as if it must be inexhaustible,
even when it is remembered that thousands are stolen
annually by the Nubians. There are tracts of grazing ground
which take a whole day to cross; murahs are scattered
throughout the land like villages in Germany, and many of
them would contain 10,000 beasts, unless I err in my computation,
which is made by reckoning the pegs to which the
animals are tethered.</p>

<p>Before I parted from my old friend Shol I had to make
one more offering of gratitude for the hospitality I had enjoyed;
this consisted of an amulet which I had to compose
at Kurdyook’s request. I wrote him as a testimonial a
recommendation to any future visitor to the country. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Nubians and true Arabs, in a way that is not seen in Egypt,
often wear round their neck and arms a number of ornamental
leather sheaths, which contain passages from the
Koran; on being asked what is inside they reply, “It is the
name of God.” Such amulets are even bound round the necks
of horses and valuable asses. It would never occur to a
Nubian to ask a Frank for an amulet; they have their Faki,
who make a harvest of the business. But Kurdyook was no
Mohammedan; he was a pure, uncontaminated heathen, and
Mohammedan prejudice had no part in his superstition; in
his eyes the white man was a being of a higher order, and
was accordingly in a position to exercise greater authority
over the invisible powers of fate than the swarthy priest of
Islam.</p>

<p>We now passed on through a country covered by farmsteads,
repeatedly crossing fields of sorghum-stubble. The
stalks, fifteen feet in length, which lay everywhere scattered
on the ground, were a great impediment to our
progress. The corn here cultivated is the largest form of the
species; it takes nine months to ripen, and the stem in consequence
becomes so hard and woody that it is no more like
our European straw than their stubble-fields are like ours.
At other places at this season the nature of the ground
generally offered no hindrance, the clayey swamps being dry
and hard as stone; the high grass of the steppe trodden down
by men and cattle, the woods everywhere thin as in Southern
Nubia, and consisting of isolated thickets or scattered trees
of no great size.</p>

<p>For the purpose of geographical investigation a journey in
the rainy season would be more advantageous, because it is
only then that the actual limit and importance of the periodical
currents are to be estimated. The term <em>periodical</em>, however,
so frequently used in connexion with the hydrographical
conditions of Africa, perhaps hardly gives a correct impression,
since the brooks and streams which more or less are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
dried up after the rainy seasons are over, still exercise their
influence on the conformation of the land, just as truly, if
not so obviously, as our perpetual rivers, which are permanently
limited to their proper channels. Many of the
rivulets in this extensive level have no apparent bed; for in
proportion as the water decreases, the bed by degrees resumes
its aspect of being covered with grass; the turf rapidly
grows afresh as the water recedes, and, independently of this,
much of it is able to endure a flood of several months without
rotting or dying away. This is a circumstance which
quite easily explains the misconceptions to which various
travellers in the dry season have been liable, who have gone
along without recognising any river-beds at all. It is not in
any way surprising that they have crossed the beds of even
considerable streams without perceiving in them anything
different to ordinary undulations of the ground, for there is
nothing to arrest the attention but the same uniform growth
of grass, the same dry stubble, the same scorched, trampled
stalks. Ten miles from the Meshera we reached the first
watering-place in the centre of the Lao district, an open
cultivated plain, several miles in extent, diversified with
numerous farms and hamlets. Two fine sycamores seemed
to beckon from afar and invite us to the spot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HALT AT LAO.</div>

<p>The water had to be drawn from a depth of fifteen feet,
from wells which contained nothing better than a stinking,
impure pulp. These wells are the residue of great pools
formed in the rainy season, and subsequently developing a
wonderful abundance of animal life, although they produce
nothing in any way adapted for culinary purposes. Large
water-scorpions (<i lang="la">Belostoma</i>), beetles, and other creeping
things that are ever at home in stinking pools, whirl about in
these muddy depths. Here it is, apparently, that the Dinka
cows and sheep renew annually their progeny of intestinal
worms (<i lang="la">Amphistoma</i>) and cercariæ, of which the filthy beds
are most prolific. Such was the drinking-water of Lao.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>The natives had imagined that we should pass the night
at the well; anxious, however, to take advantage of the
coolness of the air, we resolved, by a forced night-march,
to get quickly over the district, void of water, that lay
before us. Marching on through the adjacent farms we
noticed old and young hurrying off into the adjacent
thickets, our arrival being unexpected. Many a smoking
porridge-pot had been forsaken, and now fell into the hands
of the greedy bearers, making them still more desirous of
tarrying here for the night; but the orders were peremptory
which had been given to our people to push forward
without delay.</p>

<p>To the south the ground stretched uniformly for ten miles
in sandy plains bare of grass, pleasantly broken at intervals
by bushy shrubs and single trees. Onwards we went for
five hours of the night over moonlit sands, the imagination
giving a weird aspect to all around. The region strongly
reminded me of the acacia-woods of Taka and Gedaref in
South Nubia, which are seen in crossing the forests at the
foot of the Abyssinian highlands. The character of the
vegetation approximates to that of Kordofan. The commonest
trees are the Seyal-acacia, hegelig, tamarind, Christ’s
thorn, capparis, and that remarkable thorn, the randia, the
branches of which serve as models for the pointed lances
which the inhabitants of Central Africa employ. One of
the trees of Southern Kordofan finds here its southern limit:
this is the <i lang="la">Albizzia sericocephala</i>, a tree of moderate size,
of which the finely-articulated, mimosa-like leaf consists
of from 5000 to 6000 particles; the thick clusters of
blossom gleamed out from the obscurity like snow, and
the air was laden with their balmy fragrance. Thus we
wandered on as through a cultivated garden, our path as
smooth as if we were on gravelled walks. Reaching at
length a considerable village, we encamped on the deserted
site of a large cattle-park. A sudden storm of rain put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
the caravan into a commotion, and forced me to retire
with my bedding into one of the wretched huts, which are
not really dwellings, but are used for the nightly shelter
of the cow-herds. Imbedded a foot deep in fine white
ashes, and enveloped in a cloud of dust, I passed the
remainder of the night, alternate coughing and sneezing
making all sleep simply impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VILLAGE OF TAKE.</div>

<p>On the following day we had to march for five hours
without a draught of water, until a hospitable asylum was
opened to us in a village of Take. We were now in the
district of the Rek, a locality which formerly made a hitch
in the traffic with the natives, before Petherick broke a way
to the south through the Dyoor and Bongo, and opened a
trade with the Niam-niam.</p>

<p>This Take was an old friend and ally of the Khartoomers,
and had attired himself in honour of the occasion in a
figured calico shirt, without regard to the prejudices of his
countrymen, who despise all clothing as effeminate. Near this
village in 1858 there existed a temporary establishment from
in which the brothers Poncet started on their elephant hunts
the Dinka territory. They called the place Mirakok, but
Mirakok and its elephants are now alike unknown in this
land of the past, where (transient as a shower or a tide) all
the lives and deeds of men have been long forgotten. It has
been a land without chalk or stone, so that no permanent
buildings could be constructed; it has consequently only
reared a people which have been without chiefs, without
traditions, without history. Detached fan-palms (<i lang="la">Borassus</i>),
100 feet high, in default of anything more lasting, mark
the abode of Take, a shelter which was destined to have its
sad associations for the travellers.</p>

<p>Ghattas’s standard-bearer, a most courageous fellow and
the best shot among all our Nubians, killed himself on a
hunting excursion, which he had undertaken with me and
my servant. I had contented myself with bagging a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
remarkably plump wild pigeons, but he was resolved to get
at some guinea-fowl; for this purpose he made his way into
a thicket, where, as he was loading his piece, it accidentally
went off, the charge entering his breast. This accident
befell the one who was supposed to be incomparably the
most skilful of our party in handling his weapons, and it
may be imagined what was to be expected of the rest.
Blundering accidents and wounds were of perpetual occurrence,
so that I should only weary the reader by recounting
them. The traveller who has to march with these so-called
soldiers must be content to know that he could not anywhere
more thoroughly be exposed to the danger of being
killed by a chance shot; and I do not exaggerate the truth
when I affirm that my life was over and over again seriously
threatened.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Soliman, who was thus the victim of his
own mischance, was the man who had saved my servant
Mohammed when he had his encounter with the wild
buffalo. Half the camp hastened to the ill-fated spot, to
be enabled to testify to the accidental death of Soliman
by his own hand. So quietly had he fallen that even my
servant Osman, who was near, ascertained quite casually that
he was dead; a dark mark, caused by the smoke from the
powder, at the orifice of the gaping wound, showed that his
gun had gone off while he was holding it. Sobbing and
weeping, his friends and countrymen stood round his body,
and even the stony-hearted cattle-stealers seemed as if, after
all, they were not utterly devoid of all human emotion.
One of them was touched with a strange remorse, the reason
of which I afterwards discovered. It appeared that Soliman
owed him a debt, which he declared he had paid; on the
previous day, while Soliman had been emphatically persisting
that the debt was discharged, his accuser, in his
rage, cursed him with the heaviest imprecation he could
command: “The dogs devour thee!” The disaster, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
was a manifest punishment from heaven; the man
would indeed gladly have never uttered the curse, but yet
he could not be reconciled with the dead. On the very
next day, as we were about to start, another man shattered
the upper part of his arm by carelessly taking his gun from
a bush where he had laid it.</p>

<p>We left the unlucky spot, and proceeded two miles further
to the village of Kudy, also an old friend of the Turks,
as the Khartoomers are everywhere termed by the natives.
Here we made another halt, in order to pass the day in
slaughtering some cattle, in feasting on beef and goat’s
flesh, and in laying in a store of corn for our large party of
bearers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEGAL AFFIDAVIT.</div>

<p>Here also a kind of affidavit or protocol, strictly conformable
to Mohammedan rule, was taken of the previous
day’s accident, in order to be able to produce legal evidence
at Khartoom, where the deceased Soliman had left a wife
and child. The chief part of this important business was
performed by the Faki, who accompanied the party as
private slave-dealers, enacting at the same time their legal
character as scribes. After the protocol was drawn up, it
was sealed, according to Oriental custom, by the agents who
were present. This was not done without great prolixity
and circumstantial debate. The formality of the document
was curious; its opening words were: “Osman the agent
asks Osman the servant of the lord Musyu the question:
Where is Soliman?” Osman in his turn had to give an
account of the accident: “As we were hunting in the
thicket, I heard a shot,” and so on. They did not expect
to be cross-examined; they did not look for even such
mild reproach as the king gave Hamlet when he inquired,
“Where’s Polonius?” but they considered it quite as well to
keep up the old-established form.</p>

<p>With Kudy I found a good opportunity of prosecuting my
study of the Dinka, which I had already taken up in earnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
during my stay in the Meshera. My relations with this
strange pastoral people were, throughout the two years which
I spent in the interior, but rarely discontinued. Dinka were
my cow-herds, and Dinka provided me with all the requirements
of my <i lang="fr">cuisine</i> as long as I stayed in Ghattas’s Seriba;
and even in the remotest limits of my wanderings I had
dealings with them. I am only acquainted with the western
branch of this people, whose territory altogether extends
over an area of from 60,000 to 70,000 square miles, of which
the length is close upon 400 miles; my knowledge, however,
is accurate enough to enable me from my own observation
to add much that is new to the descriptions which previous
travellers have given of this people.</p>

<p>Although individual tribes of the Dinka, with regard to
height and bodily size, stand pre-eminent in the scale of the
human race, the majority of this western branch of the
nation rarely exceeds a middle height. Of twenty-six
representatives that were measured, the average height was
about 5 ft. 7 in. According to this, the average size of the
Dinka is inferior to that of the Kaffirs, but it exceeds that of
Englishmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEGRO PHYSIOGNOMY.</div>

<p>In their figure they are like the <em>swamp-men</em>, if such an
expression may be allowed, presenting the same lankiness of
limb which has been already noticed as characteristic of the
Shillooks and Nueir. The upper part of the body appears
shorter than among the less swarthy and more robust races
who inhabit the rocky hills of the interior. The outline of
their sinewy frame is very decidedly marked in the horizontal,
angular shoulders; a long neck, slightly contracted
at the base, corresponds with the head, which also gradually
contracts towards the top and back, and which is generally
somewhat flat and narrow. Ordinarily there is a strongly
developed width of jaw. Altogether there is a general harmony
pervading the whole figure, and the scientific student
will hardly fail to recognise the evidence that nature has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
pursued a definite end in the development which here exists.
The Dinka must be reckoned amongst the darkest of races,
but the deep black of their complexion gives place to a
manifest tint of brown when the ashes are washed off with
which they delight in rubbing themselves. When they have
smeared themselves with oil, or taken a bath, their skin
shines like dark bronze. The dull polish of chocolate may
be taken as descriptive of the brighter hue; this, however,
is seldom seen even when the ashes are cleared away, because
the removal of the dead scales of cuticle, which then takes
place, is followed by a greyish tint which spreads over the
skin.</p>

<p>The blue tinge which has been attributed to the negro’s
skin is entirely a matter of imagination; it may be confidently
asserted to be solely the reflection of the sky. This
result of reflection is especially to be observed when we
chance to see one of these swarthy fellows standing at the
aperture of his gloomy hut, which gets no light but what
enters by the door.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br>

 alt="Profiles of the Dinka">
 <p class="caption">Profiles of the Dinka.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Any apparent uniformity of physiognomy is all an illusion:
it originates more in the inexperience of the eye than in any
positive resemblance of feature. The three profiles of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
illustrations are given show a marked variety in form
between nose and nose. Generally, however, according to
our conventional æsthetic notions, the men are more comely
than the women of the same age. Pleasant, not to say
ordinarily human features, are rare: hideous contortions,
increased by the grimaces to which the short eyebrows
contribute by reducing the shallow foreheads to a mere
nothing, give the majority an expression scarcely better
than a baboon’s. Still there are exceptions, and with regard
to these it must at times be owned that they present
a regularity of feature with which no fault could be found.</p>

<p>The hair of the Dinka is nearly always very meagre; it is
generally closely shorn, except at the crown, where a tuft is
left, which they ornament with ostrich feathers, in imitation
of a heron. The helmet-shaped combs of the Shillooks are
never seen, but tufts of woolly locks are much in fashion.
Occasionally, but not often, the hair is plaited in fine braids,
which run in parallel lines across the head. The women
wear their hair either closely shaven or as short as possible.</p>

<p>The accompanying portrait represents what might be
styled a Dinka dandy, distinguished for unusually long hair.
He must be classed as belonging to that finer-formed race
which has been mentioned. By continual combing and
stroking with hair-pins, the hair of the negro loses much of
its close curliness. Such was the case here: the hair, six
inches long, was trained up into points like tongues of flame,
and these, standing stiffly up all round his head, gave the
man a fiendish look, which was still further increased by its
being dyed a foxy red.</p>

<p>This tint is the result of continual washing with cow-urine;
a similar effect can be produced by the application for a
fortnight of a mixture of dung and ashes. The beard never
attains sufficient growth to be worth their attention. Their
razors are of the most primitive description, consisting simply
of carefully ground lance-tips.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAIR AND TEETH OF THE DINKA.</div>

<p>Both sexes break off the lower incisor teeth, a custom
which they practise in common with the majority of the
natives of the district of the Bahr-el-Ghazal. The object of
this hideous mutilation is hard to determine; its effect appears
in their inarticulate language, of which I suppose we
could not imitate the sound, unless we submitted to the same
ordeal. Some Africans file their incisor teeth to a point;
others, like the Batoka of the Upper Zambesi, break out
those of the upper jaw. The former of these practices appears
comprehensible as increasing their capability for defence in
single combat; and the latter is perhaps an imitation of their
deified ruminants; but the reason why the Dinka should
absolutely disfigure their lower jaw is quite beyond my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
comprehension. The African races have commonly been
reported as distinguished for their fine rows of teeth, and it
was accordingly a matter of surprise that bad teeth were so
often conspicuous. The aged on this account are little short
of disgusting, for the upper teeth, from the deficiency of
opposition from the lower, project far from the mouth and
stick out like a finger-joint. So marked is this peculiarity
that some of the people have acquired from the Nubians the
<i lang="fr">soubriquet</i> of Abu-Senoon, father jut-tooth.</p>

<p>Men and women alike pierce their ears in several places,
and insert iron rings or little bars with iron tips. The
women also bore the upper lip and fit in an iron pin, running
through a bead, a custom which is common among the
Nueir. Tattooing is only practised by the men, and always
consists of about ten radiating strokes, which traverse
forehead and temples, having for their centre the glabella,
or base of the nose: it is a symbol by which the Dinka are
recognised at once.</p>

<p>The observation of Barth,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that many heathen tribes consider
clothing more necessary for men than for women is
not applicable to the Dinka or any of the natives of the
river plains. According to Dinka notions of propriety, it is
becoming for none but women to wear any covering; any
attire, even of the most moderate description, is considered
unworthy of the men. The Nubians, who are always called
Turks, do not certainly belong to the most carefully clothed
of the human race, yet the Dinka always term them <em>women</em>,
a designation which in this sense is quite common. I always
appeared in a complete suit of clothes, and my apparel
accordingly gained for me the ironical title of the “Turkish
lady.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DINKA ORNAMENTS.</div>

<p>On the other hand the women here are scrupulously
clothed with two aprons of untanned skin, which reach before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
and behind from the hips to the ankles, and are trimmed
round the edges with rows of beads, small iron rings, and
little bells. At that time, white beads, as large as peas, with
blue spots, called “Genetot ahdah” in the Khartoom market,
and others an inch in diameter, called “Barrad” or hailstones,
which were principally worn by the men as necklaces,
were all the rage, every other description being contemptuously
rejected. In the course of a few years the fashions
in beads change, and the store-houses in the Seribas of the
Khartoomers get overstocked with supplies that are old-fashioned,
and are consequently worthless.</p>

<p>The Dinka live in a veritable iron age—&#8203;that is to say, they
live in an age in which iron has still a high value; copper
is not esteemed of corresponding importance. The wives of
some of the wealthy are often laden with iron to such a
degree that, without exaggeration, I may affirm, that I have
seen several carrying about with them close upon half a
hundredweight of these savage ornaments. The heavy rings
with which the women load their wrists and ankles, clank and
resound like the fetters of slaves. Free from any other
domination, it is remarkable of this people how, nevertheless,
they are not free from the fetters of fashion. The favourite
ornaments of the men are massive ivory rings, which they
wear round the upper part of the arm; the rich adorn themselves
from elbows to wrists with a whole series of rings,
close together so as to touch. An adornment for the neck of
less distinguished character is formed of strings of plaited
leather; the bracelets are cut out of hippopotamus hide;
and the tails of cows and goats, in which every Dinka exquisite
arrays himself, and with which he trims his weapons, are
in common use.</p>

<p>Since the Dinka cannot do much with his miserable crop of
hair, he turns his attention to caps and perukes in a way not
unfrequent among Africans. Whilst I was with Kudy I often
saw those strange specimens of head-gear which, in the shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of a Circassian chain-helmet, are formed exclusively of large
white bugle-beads, which in Khartoom are called “muria.”
This decoration is especially common amongst the Nueir.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Another kind of head-dress is composed of ostrich feathers,
and forms a light and effectual protection from the sun.</p>

<p>According to the custom, which seems to belong to all
Africa, as a sign of grief the Dinka wear a cord round the
neck; but amongst other nations we shall have occasion
to notice several additional tokens to denote the loss of
a member of a family.</p>

<p>Since the western territories of the Dinka in the alluvial
flats nowhere produce any iron, their modes of manipulation
of this metal are not so highly developed as among some
other tribes which will subsequently come under our observation.
Before the appearance of the Khartoomers, the
Dyoor, who had settled within the limits of the Bongo and
Dinka, in the vicinity of the soil which produced iron-ore,
had performed all the smith’s work which was required by
the Dinka. At that time these Dyoor seem to have been
brought by the Dinka to a similar state of vassalage as that
in which they themselves now stand to the Nubians. The
Bongo, although their land produces iron, were far too hostile
to their neighbours to furnish them with a supply of iron in
the way of commerce. The Dinka themselves, being exclusively
occupied with their cattle-breeding, have no taste
and find little time for any arduous work of the smithy;
hence it happens that although their iron ornaments are
numerous, the workmanship of them all is of the most
primitive character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DINKA WEAPONS.</div>

<p>The most important weapon of the Dinka is the lance.
Bows and arrows are unknown: the instruments that some
travellers have mistaken for bows are only weapons of defence
for parrying the blows of clubs. But really their favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
weapons are clubs and sticks, which they cut out of the
hard wood of the Hegelig (<i lang="la">Balanites</i>), or from the native
ebony (<i lang="la">Diospyrus mespiliformis</i>). This mode of defence is
ridiculed by other nations, and the Niam-niam, with whom
the Dinka have become acquainted by accompanying the
Khartoomers in their ivory expeditions, deride them as
“A-Tagbondo,” or stick-people.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i155"></a>
<br>
 <img src="images/i_155.jpg"
 alt="Dinka Instruments">
 <p class="caption">Dinka Instruments for parrying club blows.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Similar conditions of life in different regions, even among
dissimilar races, ever produce similar habits and tendencies.
This is manifest in the numerous customs which the Dinka
possess in common with the far-off Kaffirs. They have the
same predilection for clubs and sticks, and use a shield of
the same long oval form, cut out of buffalo hide, and which,
in order to insure a firmer hold, is crossed by a stick, secured
by being passed through slits cut in the thick leather. But
the instruments for parrying club-blows depicted in the
accompanying illustration are quite peculiar to the Dinka.
As far as I know, no previous traveller has drawn attention
to these strange contrivances for defence. They are of two
kinds. One consists of a neatly-carved piece of wood, rather
more than a yard long, with a hollow in the centre for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
protection of the hand: these are called “quayre.” The
other, which has been mistaken for a bow, is termed “dang,”
of which the substantial fibres seem peculiarly fitted for
breaking the violence of any blow.</p>

<p>Everywhere, beyond a question, domestic cleanliness and
care in the preparation of food are signs of a higher grade
of external culture, and answer to a certain degree of intellectual
superiority. I have travelled much in Europe, where
the diversity of the external conditions of life is greater than
in any other quarter of the world; I have had much opportunity
of observation, and I am sure that I do not err in the
conclusion that I draw. Not the size of the houses, nor the
dimensions of the windows (for these are variously influenced
by climate), not the clothing (for Sards, Dalmatians, and
Albanians, incontestably the least civilised of Europeans,
are the most magnificently attired of all), but cleanliness
and choice of food not only at once disclose a real distinction
between nation and nation, but constitute a measure of the
degrees of civilisation in individual provinces and districts.
Now both these qualities, I aver, are found among the Dinka
to a greater extent than elsewhere in Africa. First, as to
the food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DINKA MEALS.</div>

<p>In culinary matters the Dinka are certainly superior to
the Nubians, and I should have little hesitation in pronouncing
them even more expert than either the Arabs or the
Egyptians. Their farinaceous and milk foods are in no way
inferior to the most refined products of an European <i lang="fr">cuisine</i>.
The reaping, threshing, and sifting of the sorghum and
penicillaria grain (the durra and dokhn of the Arabs) are
brought to perfection by their female slaves, who subsequently
granulate the meal like sago. In seasons of
scarcity their talent for cooking has led them to the discovery
of various novelties in the way of food. Like the
tribes of Baghirmi, the Musgoo, and Adamawa, they make
a preparation, very much in the Indian fashion, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
farinaceous germs of the Borassus palm. They extract
all its native bitterness by soaking and washing, and succeed
in producing a fine meal, which is purely white. The substance
procured from these germinating seeds has a look very
similar to the root of the Florentine iris. They treat the
tubers of the Nymphæa in very much the same way, and
render them quite edible.</p>

<p>With the choice cookery corresponds also the decorum
of their behaviour at meals. They certainly, in this point,
more resemble ourselves than any Orientals. They do not
all dip their hands at once into the same dish, like the Turks
and Arabs, but assist themselves singly. A large dish of
cooked farina is placed upon the ground, around which the
guests recline, each with his gourd-shell of milk, or, better
still, of butter, at his side; the first pours his milk only on
the part which he touches, and when he has taken enough,
he passes the dish to the next, and thus they eat in succession,
but quite separately. The Dinka repudiate the Oriental
superstition that envious looks can turn the food to poison,
and have no fear of the “evil eye.”</p>

<p>At times it greatly amused me to entertain Dinka ladies
of rank in my tent, in order to pay them the compliment of
my admiration of their perfection in the arts of cookery.
On my folding table I laid out for them some European
dishes, and they sat on my chairs. I was astonished at the
readiness with which they fell into our mode of serving, for
they handled our spoons and forks as if they were perfectly
accustomed to them; but they nearly always carefully
washed everything they had used, and returned it to its
place.</p>

<p>In the interior of their dwellings, the Dinka are as clean
as the Shillooks, sharing the same partiality for ashes as a
bed. It ought to be mentioned that the traveller in this
part of Africa is rarely troubled with vermin or fleas, which
everywhere else, like desolation and slavery, seem invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
to have followed the track of Islam. In the Western Soudan
the torments of the night are represented as insupportable,
so that the huts of the Hottentots are not worse. Among
the Dinka it is entirely different. The only disquietude to
a stranger in their houses arises from the snakes, which rustle
in the straw roofs, and disturb his rest. Snakes are the
only creatures to which, either Dinka or Shillooks pay any
sort of reverence. The Dinka call them their “brethren,”
and look upon their slaughter as a crime. I was informed
by witnesses which I had no cause to distrust, that the separate
snakes are individually known to the householder, who
calls them by name, and treats them as domestic animals.
Their abundance here seemed to me very remarkable.
Among the Bongo, on the other hand, I spent six months
before I saw a single specimen, and it appears to be an established
fact that, upon the whole, they are not generally
common in Tropical Africa. Perhaps the species which is
most frequent is the giant python (<i lang="la">Sebæ</i>). Those which
inhabit the Dinka huts are, as far as I could learn, not
venomous; and, as evidence that they are harmless, I cite
the scientific names of the three species: <i lang="la">Psammophis punctatus</i>,
<i lang="la">Ps. sibilans</i>, and <i lang="la">Ahaetuella irregularis</i>.</p>

<p>The Dinka are far more particular than any other tribe
in the choice of their animal food. There are many creeping
things, which are not rejected by the Bongo and Niam-niam,
which they loathe with the utmost disgust. Crocodiles,
iguanas, frogs, crabs, and mice they never touch; but,
connoisseurs of what is good, they use turtles for making
soup. It is scarcely necessary to say that the accounts of the
cannibalism of the Niam-niam excite as much horror amongst
them as amongst ourselves. Nothing, likewise, is more
repulsive to them than dog’s flesh, which is enjoyed by the
Mittoo—&#8203;a fact which justifies us in the supposition that that
tribe is addicted to cannibalism. Dinka, as well as Bongo,
have declared to me in the most decided manner, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
would rather die of hunger than eat the flesh of a dog. But
a delicious morsel to the Dinka is the wild cat of the steppes,
which is often found in this part of Africa, and is the origin of
our domestic cat, to which it bears no slight resemblance.
But more delicious than all they esteem the hare; and in
order to illustrate their appreciation of it, a Dinka, to whom
I was talking, naïvely asked me whether I knew what a
Dinka did when he managed to kill a hare on the steppe by
a lucky blow of his club? “He makes a fire,” he added,
“and roasts his game and eats it quietly, without saying
anything about it at home.”</p>

<p>Even before they had any intercourse with Mohammedan
countries, a love of tobacco-smoking had been one of the
traits of the Dinka, who use the same huge pipe-bowls as we
have already observed amongst the Shillooks. A strong stem
opens into a small calabash, which serves as a mouth-piece,
and is filled with fine bast, to intercept the narcotic oils.
Denarcotinizing, as it is termed, is quite an old African
invention. Here, where tobacco does not grow at all plentifully,
the process answers a double purpose, for, by taking
off the top of the pipe, the bast can be removed, and, impregnated
as it is with tobacco oil, it is subsequently chewed.
The smoking apparatus is so ponderous that every one is
obliged to sit down while he smokes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DINKA DWELLINGS.</div>

<p>The Dinka dwellings consist of small groups of huts clustered
in farmsteads over the cultivated plains. Villages in
a proper sense there are none; but the cattle of separate
districts are united in a large park, which the Khartoomers
call a “murah.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The accompanying drawing represents
a Dinka farm surrounded by sorghum fields. Of the three
huts, the one in the centre, with a double porchway, is set
apart for the head of the family; that on the left is for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
women; whilst the largest and most imposing hut on the
right is a hospital for sick cows, which require, to be separated
from the throngs in the murah that they may receive proper
attention. Under an awning in the centre of the huts is the
fireplace for the cooking, sheltered from the wind by a semicircular
screen of clay. The goats are kept within a small
thorn fence, so that the daily supply of milk may be always
at hand.</p>

<p>As a rule the huts of the Dinka are spacious, and more
durable than those of other tribes who build their dwellings
in the same conical form. They are not unfrequently 40
feet in diameter; their foundations are composed of a mixture
of clay and chopped straw, and the supports of the roof
are made of branches of acacia and other hard woods. Not
content with supporting these with a single central prop, the
Dinka erect a trunk with its spreading branches in the middle.
The roof is contrived out of layers
of cut straw. These buildings endure
for eight or ten years, and
decay at length mainly through
being worm-eaten. The huts of
the Bongo, on the contrary, are
built up much more rapidly, but
rarely last as much as three
years.</p>

<p>The principal plants that are here cultivated are sorghum
and penicillaria, three kinds of beans, earth-nuts (<i lang="la">Arachis</i>),
earth-peas (<i lang="la">Voandzeia subterranea</i>), sesame, yams, and Virginian
tobacco; but we shall have a more ample opportunity
of entering into the details of these crops when we speak of
the Bongo, who cultivate nearly the same products of the
soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DINKA CATTLE.</div>

<p>The domestic animals are oxen, sheep, goats, and dogs;
poultry was never to be seen, and the cause of its absence is
inexplicable. The cattle belong to the Zebu race, and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
smaller than those of the Baggara and Hassanieh; they
have a hump, their horns are slender, the fore part of the
body prevailing so in size as to resemble an antelope. As to
colour, the majority are nearly white, but it would be incorrect
to say that either the speckled or the striped, the tawny
or the brown, are wanting. The Dinka have separate expressions
to denote every shade of colour of the breed, and,
indeed, their vocabulary for all that relates to cattle and
cattle-breeding is more copious than that of any European
tongue.</p>

<br>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The sheep are of a peculiar breed, which is unique amongst
the Dinka, Nueir, and Shillooks; farther on in the interior
of the equatorial districts it is not known. Its chief characteristic
consists of a shaggy appendage to the shoulders,
breast, and neck, like a mane, whilst on the rest of the body,
and on the meagre tail, the hair is quite short. This mantle
of hair gives them an appearance like diminutive buffaloes,
whilst their plump bodies and short legs increase the resemblance.
Generally white, they are occasionally brown or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
spotted, and in some rare cases I have seen them of quite a
reddish hue.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Like the pastoral people of Southern Africa,
the Dinka have acquired the art of splitting the horns in
their early growth, so as to increase their number at will.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i162"></a>
<br>
 <img src="images/i_162.jpg"
 alt="Dinka Sheep">
 <p class="caption">Dinka Sheep.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The continual dampness of the pasture, especially throughout
the rainy season, favours the development of revolting
intestinal vermes, and the rain-pools in the dry months
become most prolific as breeding-places for Cercariæ. I have
frequently seen sheep suffering under disease, their ailment
arising from their liver and gall-ducts being choked up by
these worms. The distoma, which is a denizen of every zone
and extends even to Greenland, is found here an inch long.</p>

<p>The race of goats bred by the Dinka does not differ materially
from the Ethiopian form, which we have already
noticed<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> among the Bedouins of Nubia; its only distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
is being somewhat larger; in appearance it is always
meagre, and its prevailing colour is that of a young grey
colt, occasionally inclining to a dark iron-grey.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 alt="Dinka Goat">
 <p class="caption">Dinka Goat.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<div class="sidenote">DINKA DOG.</div>

<p>The dogs closely resemble the common village curs of
Nubia, a cross between the greyhound of the Nubian steppes
and the pariah of the streets of Cairo. It is not unusual for
their colour to be brown, but by far the larger number are
a tawny yellow.</p>

<p>Every idea and thought of the Dinka is how to acquire and
maintain cattle: a kind of reverence would seem to be paid to
them; even their offal is considered of high importance; the
dung, which is burnt to ashes for sleeping in and for smearing
their persons, and the urine, which is used for washing and as
a substitute for salt, are their daily requisites. It must be
owned that it is hard to reconcile this latter usage with our
ideas of cleanliness. A cow is never slaughtered, but when
sick it is segregated from the rest, and carefully tended in
the large huts built for the purpose. Only those that die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
naturally or by an accident are used as food. All this, which
exists amongst most of the pastoral tribes of Africa, may perchance
appear to be a lingering remnant of an exploded
cattle-worship; but I may draw attention to the fact that the
Dinka are by no means disinclined to partake of any feast of
their flesh, provided that the slaughtered animal was not
their own property. It is thus more the delight of actual
possession, than any superstitious estimate, that makes the
cow to them an object of reverence. Indescribable is the grief
when either death or rapine has robbed a Dinka of his cattle.
He is prepared to redeem their loss by the heaviest sacrifices,
for they are dearer to him than wife or child. A dead cow
is not, however, wantonly buried; the negro is not sentimental
enough for that; such an occurrence is soon bruited
abroad, and the neighbours institute a carousal, which is quite
an epoch in their monotonous life. The bereaved owner
himself is, however, too much afflicted at the loss to be able
to touch a morsel of the carcase of his departed beast. Not
unfrequently in their sorrow the Dinka remain for days
silent and abstracted, as though their trouble were too heavy
for them to bear.</p>

<p>The only domestic animal which is slaughtered amongst
them is the goat, which scarcely represents the thirtieth part
of the value of a cow. A heifer has three times the value,
and a cow that has calved double the value of a steer. In
common with the other tribes of this part of Africa they use
rather a singular method of butchering their cattle, proceeding,
whenever it is practicable, by the way of making a violent
stab in the nape of the neck by means of a spear. This
causes immediate death, and is a method which gives but
little trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEGENERATION OF CATTLE.</div>

<p>It is not difficult to understand how people like the Dinka
should make their whole delight to centre in having thriving
cattle-farms, but to us their profitless practice of emasculation
must remain incomprehensible. The herdsmen cut their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
bulls and bucks with the mere intention of feasting their
eyes upon a development of fat which is always obnoxious to
the stomach. Almost the third part of their bulls are submitted
to the knife, and the same proportion of their goats
and rams, and even their dogs, with the design of rendering
them more agile, more, enduring, and fitter for the chase; this
also being the reason why their ears and tails are clipped.
Ask the Dinka what good they get from their possessions of
oxen, and they have ever the answer ready that it is quite
enough if they get fat and look nice. Such is the way in
which they express their satisfaction and their pride.</p>

<p>The failure of the beard amongst the male cattle so treated
is a topic that suggests some observations. In spite of the
anxiety and care which the Dinka bestow upon their herds,
there is no mistake about the degeneration of the race. The
way in which I chiefly account for this is that there is not
enough crossing of breeds—&#8203;in fact, that there is almost a total
exclusion of any strange stock. I should say that hardly one
in a hundred of the beasts is capable of either bearing a
burden or going a journey, a purpose, however, to which none
of the negroes of the Upper Nile ever seem to put them.
But nothing is more remarkable than the entire absence of
fat which characterises them; a single pound of fat could not
be obtained from a whole ox; and not only does this deficiency
extend to the parts that are ordinarily plump and
fleshy, but the spinal marrow itself is so utterly dry that in
a stewpan it runs off like white of egg, without depositing a
particle of grease. Eye-witnesses have assured me that Miss
Tinné, during her residence here, although she had whole
herds at her command, could never get her supply of pomade
replenished.</p>

<p>Again the cattle of the Dinka are not provided with salt
in any form whatever, which may in a measure account for
the degenerating; it may explain the prevalence, all but
universal, of the worms known as “kyatt,” which cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
the first stomach or paunch, of nearly all their cattle.
These worms in Europe are included in the genus of the
Amphistoma; they are like an
oval bag, something under half
an inch long, and generally as red
as port wine.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The sheep and he-goats that
are left are quite devoid of fat;
their flesh when it is cooked has
an odious soapy flavour, and is
altogether more repulsive than the rankest roast antelope.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the degree to which the Dinka devote
all their attention to cattle-breeding, and find their chief
delight in it, it may be mentioned that the great amusement
of the children is to mould goats and bullocks out of clay.
Travellers have related the same fact about the children of
the Makololo; and, for my part, I could not help having a
kind of satisfaction when I saw these first efforts at sculpture
in a land where there are no pictures and no images of deities.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The accompanying illustration is designed to exhibit something
of the daily routine of the Dinka. It represents one of
those murahs or cattle-parks, of which I have seen hundreds.
It depicts the scene at about five o’clock in the afternoon.
In the foreground there are specimens of the cattle of the
country. The men in charge are busied in collecting up into
heaps the dung that has been exposed during the day to be
dried in the sun. Clouds of reeking vapour fill the murah
throughout the night and drive away the pestiferous insects.
The herds have just been driven to their quarters, and each
animal is fastened by a leather collar to its own wooden peg.
Towards the left, on a pile of ashes, sit the owners of this
section of the murah. The ashes which are produced in the
course of a year raise the level of the entire estate. Semicircular
huts erected on the hillocks afford the owners temporary
accommodation when they quit their homes some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
miles away and come to feast their eyes upon the goodly
spectacle of their wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DINKA POPULATION.</div>

<p>The milking is performed in the morning hours. Truly
miserable is the yield, and the most prolific of the cows does
not give as much as one of our ordinary goats. This deficiency
of milk is another witness of the deterioration of the
breed, and no one would believe the quantity of milk it takes
to produce a single pound of butter. The dew hardly goes
off before ten o’clock, and it is not until that hour that the
herds are driven out. It is quite rare for a murah to hold
less than 2000 beasts, and some, as I have mentioned, are
capable of holding 10,000. Upon an average I should reckon
that for every head of the population there would be found
at least three of cattle; of course, there is no lack of the poor
and the destitute, and these obviously are the slaves and
dependents of the rich. So large are the numbers of the
Dinka, and so extensive their territory, that it must be expected
that they will long perpetuate their existence amongst
the promiscuous inhabitants of Africa. So far as regards
their race, their line of life, and their customs, they have all
the material of national unity; but where they fail is that
their tribes not only make war upon each other, but submit
to be enlisted as the instruments of treachery by intruders
from outside. That the Khartoomers have not been able
hitherto to make good their footing upon Dinka soil is due
more to a general resistance to external control than to any
internal condition of concord. Every attempt to bring this
people into subjection has been quite a failure, and not at all
the easy matter it proved with the Bongo and some other
communities. The southern people are emphatically agricultural,
for the most part devoted to peaceful pursuits, and so they
are wanting in that kind of organisation which could unite
them into a formidable body for mutual resistance. The
marked peculiarity of the Dinka, as well as their adherence to
all their wonted habits, renders them thoroughly useless as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
as regards the slave traffic. Although the people of Khartoom
for fifteen years or more have traversed their country, they have
never been able in any way to make use of the material which
might be afforded by a regulated commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>The Bongo and the Niam-niam are alike greedy of bits of
clothing, but the Dinka are utterly indifferent to anything
of the sort. The women, on account of their proficiency in
housekeeping, play a large part in the Khartoom slave-trade,
but they give their masters infinitely more trouble than the
slaves of any other race. The men that were captured, in
days now gone by, were one and all converted into soldiers by
the Government, and, even to this date, so large a majority
of the dark-skinned troops of Egypt consists of men of the
Dinka, that their well-formed persons, their tall stature, and
their innate courage, would be missed very considerably from
the ranks. Adam Pasha, who at the time of my visit had the
military command in the Soudan, was himself a Dinka by birth.</p>

<p>I must be allowed to pass lightly over, as an equivocal
topic, the religion of a people whose dialect I was unable
adequately to master. It seems to me like a desert of
mirages, or as a playground, where the children of fancy
enjoy their sport. The creed of the Dinka apparently
centres itself upon the institution to which they give the
name of the Cogyoor, and which embraces a society of necromancers
and jugglers by profession. Other travellers have
recorded a variety of marvels about their sleight of hand,
their ventriloquism, their conjurations, and their familiarity
with the ghosts of the dead; but of these I shall defer all I
have to say till I come by-and-by to speak generally about
casting out devils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DINKA CHARACTER.</div>

<p>Before we leave the Dinka we must not omit to recall
their virtues, in order that we may fairly estimate the charge
that has been laid against them of cruelty in war. It is
affirmed that they are pitiless and unrelenting in fight, that
they are never known to give quarter, and revel in wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
dances around the bodies of their slaughtered foes: a whole
village will take their share in the orgies which one of the
community will start, whenever, either by lance or club, he
has prostrated an antagonist. But, for my part, I am ready
to certify that there are Dinka whose tenderness and compassion
are beyond a question. One of the Bongo related to
me, as a matter of his own experience, that he had been
severely wounded upon an expedition which the Nubians
had set on foot against the Dinka to steal their cattle: he
had laid himself down just outside a Dinka’s house, and the
owner had not simply protected him against all his prosecutors,
who considered themselves amply justified in proceeding
to every extreme of vengeance, but kept him till he had
regained his health: not content with that, he provided him
with an escort back, and did not abandon him till he was
safe and sound again amongst his own people.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, then, that certain instances may be
alleged which seem to demonstrate that the character of the
Dinka is unfeeling, these cases never refer to such as are
bound by the ties of kindred. Parents do not desert their
children, nor are brothers faithless to brothers, but are ever
prompt to render whatever aid is possible. The accusation
is quite unjustifiable that family affection, in our sense, is at
a low ebb among them. In the spring of 1871, whilst I was
staying in the Seriba of Kurshook Ali on the Dyoor, I
witnessed a circumstance which I may relate as a singular
corroboration of my opinion. A Dinka man, who had been
one of the bearers who had carried my stores from the
Meshera, was about to return to his own home in the territory
of Ghattas, but he had been attacked by the guinea-worm,
and his feet were so swollen that it was with the
utmost difficulty that he could proceed a step, and he was
obliged to remain behind alone. Everything was excessively
scarce and dear, and he was glad to subsist on a few handfuls
of durra and on what scraps we gave him from our meals;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
in this way he dragged on, and, with a little patience, would
have been all right: however, he was not suffered to wait
long; his father appeared to fetch him. This old man had
brought neither cart nor donkey, but he set out and carried
away the great strapping fellow, who was six feet high, for a
distance of fifteen or sixteen leagues, on his own shoulders.
This incident was regarded by the other natives as a mere
matter of course.</p>

<p>In what I have said, I have attempted to describe the
leading features in the life of the Dinka, being desirous to
exhibit such details as may allow a correct judgment to be
formed of the true relations which exist between the Khartoomers
and this people, who are at once so pastoral and yet
so prepared for war.</p>

<p>Here, at the village of Kudy, our caravan had accomplished
about half its journey, which was altogether a little
over 90 miles. It was on the afternoon of the 28th of March
that we started afresh towards Ghattas’s Seriba, immediately
after the gun accident which I have related. On account of
their late liberal diet, our bearers did not advance with their
usual alacrity. We proceeded for three hours, and at a well
called Pamog, 20 feet deep, we halted for the night.</p>

<p>On the next day our route led through forests, and we
entered upon the territory of the Al-Waj. The inhabitants
regarded us as enemies, and, seizing their bows and arrows,
left their dwellings and, like frightened game, flocked to the
adjacent woods. According to our Dinka interpreters, the
Al-Waj do not belong to the Dinka race, but form an enclave,
or isolated community, of unknown origin. As we entered
the wood, for the purpose of botanising, the savages were
continually starting up before us, causing no little uneasiness
to my companions, who suspected a flight of arrows from
every thicket. To say the truth, the natives had been so
hardly treated that it could not be expected of them to meet
their oppressors very hospitably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT GHATTAS’S SERIBA.</div>

<p>We should have proceeded far more quickly, but that we
were under the necessity at every halt to send to a distance
all round to procure a fresh supply of corn for our numerous
party. This continually caused the delay of several hours,
as the farms were often very desolate and ill supplied. The
Al-Waj district is an almost unbroken forest in the midst of
open flats. Throughout the rainy season it is hardly better
than one vast puddle. The vestiges of elephants are frequent
at all times; and both right and left were giraffes
trotting over the rugged grass and wagging their tall heads.
The appearance of giraffes when they are running is very
extraordinary, and, as they are seen through the grey twilight
of the morning, they have a look half spectral and half grotesque;
they seem to nod and bow like figures in the ill-managed
drops of a second-class theatre.</p>

<p>After leaving the village of the Al-Waj we proceeded for
three leagues through the forest, and found ourselves again
on the extensive steppe. At noon on the following day we
reached the district of the Dyuihr, a clay flat, devoid of
trees. The Khartoomers cannot pronounce the native names
correctly, and call this people the Dyeraweel. The large
villages were now deserted, the population, on account of
the scarcity of water and pasturage, having gone to the river-banks.
For two nights we sacrificed our rest and hurried
onwards by forced marches. It was just before sunrise that
we reached the first rocky irregularity in the soil, a general
ascent in the ground being quite perceptible. Bush-forests
now took the place of the steppes, which we had long found
to be but scantily relieved by thickets. A luxuriant foliage
revealed itself, presenting one of those striking <em>limits of
vegetation</em> which are so rarely to be met with in Africa.
From this interesting locality I proceeded for another three
leagues, thus accomplishing the preliminary object of my
journey. I was in the chief Seriba of Ghattas, which for some
months to come I proposed to make my head-quarters.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Of</span> the character of the buildings, the arrangements and
mode of life in the settlements of the Khartoomers, I had
been able from hearsay to form a very imperfect idea. My
curiosity was therefore very considerably awakened as our
caravan approached the Seriba of Ghattas. Half a league
from the place we came to a halt in order to give the
customary warning by firing a salute, and without farther
delay started afresh. Mounted on a donkey, and surrounded
by my attendants, I went at the head of the <i lang="fr">cortége</i>. All
round the settlement for some distance the land is entirely
cultivated, and the view as we proceeded was only broken by
large trees dotted here and there, which in their summer
verdure stood out in charming contrast to the cheerless grey
of the desert steppe. Soon rising from the plain appeared
the tops of the conical huts embracing nearly the whole
horizon. I looked in vain for either fortifications, walls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
bastions, or watch-towers, with which I had imagined that a
Khartoomer’s Seriba must be provided. In fact, there was
hardly anything to distinguish it from any of the villages of
the Dinka which are scattered over the cultivated flats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECEPTION AT GHATTAS’S SERIBA.</div>

<p>A motley crowd, relieved by many a bright bit of colour,
presented itself and formed a lively spectacle such as was
scarcely to be expected to break in upon the monotony of an
African landscape. We were received with a rattling salute
from a number of rusty rifles, and there was every disposition
to do the honours of our arrival in a becoming manner.
Elegantly attired in an Oriental costume, Ghattas’s agent
approached with the gestures of welcome, and proceeded to
conduct me to the hut which for some weeks already had
been prepared for my reception. For the first time I
now observed that the area in the centre of the huts was
surrounded by a lofty square palisade; through the narrow
gateway of this, with lowered banners and amidst the sound
of gongs and kettle-drums, our cavalcade passed on.</p>

<p>With this chief Seriba are associated five smaller settlements
in the adjoining Bongo country, and four more in
remoter spots. It lies on the border-lines of the three races,
the Dinka, the Dyoor, and the Bongo. From an insignificant
beginning it had, in the course of thirteen years,
increased to its present importance. A number of Gellahba,
Nubian, and other merchants, had taken up their abode on
large estates within its precincts; and here it was that they
completed their purchases of slaves in order to carry them
on to Darfur and Kordofan. The garrison was composed
almost exclusively of natives of Dongola; there were,
however, a few Sheigeah and men of Kordofan among them,
and these, including the numerous <i lang="fr">employés</i> of Ghattas,
made the resident armed force not much under 250 men.
To these should be added some hundreds of slaves reserved
for the market, or divided as part of their pay amongst the
soldiers, and several hundreds more, male and female, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
are in actual service. The aggregate population therefore
of this establishment almost equals that of a small town,
and amounts to at least 1000 souls.</p>

<p>For two miles round the Seriba the land is partitioned
into fields. Enclosed by dense bush forests, of which the
trees rarely exceed forty feet in height, this wide expanse
is industriously tilled by the natives who have settled in the
vicinity, and furnishes the greater part of the annual supply
of sorghum necessary for the garrison. Numerous little
villages belonging to the three adjoining people are scattered
all about, the fertility of the soil, so much above the
average of the district, causing the proximity to the settlement
to be held in high estimation. The surface-soil above
the iron ore has a depth of three to four feet. The extreme
productiveness of the luxuriant tropics is well exemplified
in these fields, which for thirteen years have undergone
continual tillage without once lying fallow and with no
other manuring but what is afforded by the uprooted weeds.
A like luxuriance is characteristic of the forests, which year
after year, from the immediate vicinity, continue to supply
the spreading colony with abundance of fuel.</p>

<p>In the rainy season the place is surrounded by pools,
which disappear completely during the winter months;
parts of the soil in and about the fields become for the
time quite marshy, and at intervals large tracts of the
lower steppes, for miles together, are little better than
swamps. The Seriba is not elevated more than 100 feet
above the mean level of the Gazelle, but in spite of everything
the climate is far more salubrious and enjoyable than
in many districts of the Egyptian Soudan. This may partly
be accounted for by the fact that very few domestic animals
are kept, so that the air is uninfected by their carcases,
whilst the reverse is generally the case in the large market
towns of the Soudan. Camels, as I have said, are never
seen; horses and mules are only used as signs of special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
luxury on the part of the Seriba authorities; the ass alone
manages to drag out a precarious existence in the unfavourable
climate, and to defy the fate which has hitherto attended
all efforts for its acclimatisation. Fevers indeed are common,
though they rarely carry off new comers. Hitherto but few
white men have come to make experience of the climate in
this portion of Africa; and up to the time of my sojourn the
visits of either Turks or Egyptians had been almost as rare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNREMUNERATIVE IVORY TRAFFIC.</div>

<p>The district between Ghattas’s six Seribas in the northern
Bongo country and immediately under his authority, extends
over an area of about 200 square miles, of which at least
45 miles are under cultivation. The total population, to
judge by the number of huts and by the bearers stationed
in different parts, can hardly amount to much less than
12,000. This domain, worth millions of pounds were it
situate in Europe, might, I believe, at any time be bought
from its owner for 20,000 dollars: and this I mention as
a proof of how small is the profit actually yielded by these
settlements, which have been started by so magnificent a
spirit of enterprise. I could show by reliable statistics that
in some years the returns from the ivory have fallen far
short of the expenditure. The year of my arrival may
perhaps be considered as an average season, and in this
the ivory sent to Khartoom realised scarcely 10,000 Maria
Theresa dollars. The expenses of keeping up two or three
well-manned boats, so as to insure uninterrupted intercourse
with Khartoom, are considerable, while from any traffic in
slaves the owner of the Seriba has little to expect. In one
way, however, slaves do occasionally contribute a secondary
profit to the expeditions. In times when hostilities break
out and the proper stores from Khartoom cannot be obtained,
the agents are induced to part with whatever slaves
they have to the Gellahba for a mere bagatelle; they exchange
them for calico or anything else they can get, and
make use of the proceeds to pay the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
When affairs are prospering, a month’s pay for a soldier
is five Maria Theresa dollars. One of the great points with
the agents is to spare the merchant any outlay of ready
money: he therefore, as often as he can, pays the mercenaries
in goods, charging them exorbitant prices for any
articles obtained from his stores; on the other hand, he
makes this up to them in a measure by allowing them
a share in the plunder of slaves or of cattle; the soldiers
in their turn can dispose of what booty they may get, all
negotiations being generally conducted by the regular slave-dealers.
It is very seldom that the men are wary enough
to keep independent of the agent in their requirements, or
are able, even in the course of many years, to lay by in
Khartoom any considerable amount of money. The majority
are pledged beforehand to continual service; nevertheless
not unfrequently they contrive to escape and, without any
intimation, join the company of some competitor, who (in
the lawless condition of the country) quietly scorns all
efforts to reclaim them. Such cases as these inevitably give
rise to repeated contentions between the various Seribas.
The annual cattle-plunder, moreover, does not nearly suffice
either to attract or adequately to repay the hard services
of the Nubian soldier, nor does it go far to remunerate
the native bearers, who perform all the transport from the
Niam-niam countries to the river. All matters of commerce
even in these remote regions are ostensibly conducted
in a legitimate mercantile way. For the opening
of the ivory traffic with the Niam-niam, as well as for the
purpose of buying supplies for the people during expeditions
which often last six or seven months, huge bars of
copper and beads of every description have to be provided.
These are dear, on account of the commission which is paid
in Alexandria. The bearers, it is true, are subject with the
submission of serfs to the authorities at the Seriba; but as
an encouragement to them in their work they can claim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
a stipulated proportion of the goods, and this in the course
of the year constitutes no unimportant addition to the
outlay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IVORY TRADE.</div>

<p>Altogether the Upper Nile traffic was carried on at great
pecuniary risk, and its prospects were far from favourable.
As I saw it, it was dependent for any amount of success
upon the plunder which was made alike upon cattle and
upon men, and upon the levies of corn and provisions which
were exacted from the natives. Without the aid of the
Nubian soldiers the expeditions could not be secure. These
soldiers only come to escape the rigorousness of the Egyptian
Government in their own land; they participate in the
profits, and yet without them the monopoly could not be
maintained. The Government could avail nothing to protect
a legal business; neither could any European enterprise
hope, for many successive years, to be able to work a
profitable trade.</p>

<p>The few Europeans who ever really opened transactions in
these countries did indeed pay their people in hard cash,
and refused to have anything to do either with the slave
trade or cattle-stealing, limiting their operations exclusively
to the purchase of ivory and to elephant-hunting in the
districts adjacent to their settlements. Just as might be
expected, however, they were soon compelled to withdraw
from their undertaking—&#8203;either because, on the one hand,
the stock of ivory in their immediate vicinity was exhausted,
or, on the other, because they found that they could not compete
with the native firms, who were backed by the illegal
means I have mentioned. Since their withdrawal, no new
speculator has attempted to follow in their steps; and as
year by year the Khartoom trade loses its European representatives,
it appears as though, in course of time, the
export business will pass out of European hands. Nothing
will prevent this, unless some important modifications should
occur in the southern provinces of Egypt. Sanguine of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
success, Ismail Pasha has projected the formation of a railway
to Khartoom; and, considering the general aspect of
affairs as I have related them, this great undertaking deserves
the unqualified support of all who do not despair of
the ultimate victory of right.</p>

<p>A mere slave when at home, Ghattas’s plenipotentiary,
Idrees, was here an important personage, invested with absolute
power, and swaggered about like an autocrat. By birth
a negro, he had not on that account less influence over the
Nubians than any other official—&#8203;for it is not according to
the law of Islam to allow national enmity to be antagonistic
to personal rank. I was received with all the courtesy due to
my credentials, and for the first few days found myself literally
loaded with presents. Provisions of every sort were
placed at my disposal, whilst my people had free board for a
month in Idrees’s quarters. Two neatly-built huts of moderate
size, within the palisade, were prepared for me, but these
were not nearly sufficient to accommodate me with all my
baggage. The actual Seriba, about 200 paces square, was so
crammed with huts, that not a spot could be discovered where
it was possible to erect a more spacious residence. Outside
the enclosure, where the buildings were more scattered over
the fields, I was not permitted to lodge. I was told how it
had happened, and was likely to happen again, that the
natives skulked about at night and murdered people in their
sleep. This statement I was forced, whether I would or not,
to accept, and temporarily, at all events, to content myself
with my cramped abode, eighteen feet across.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACCOMMODATION IN THE SERIBA.</div>

<p>The huts are built of bamboo and straw; the conical roof
rests on a kind of basket-work of bamboo, which is daubed
inside with clay, in a way that is imitated from the almost
petrified erections of the white ants. The pagan negroes
lavish far more care upon their huts than the Mohammedan
inhabitants of the Soudan, who, although the bamboo grows
so abundantly among them, do not succeed in giving their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
“tokkuls” nearly so much symmetry. Here they possess
the art of erecting roofs which are perfectly water-tight, and
which are so light that they do not require heavy posts to
hold them together on the walls. The covering for the roof
is formed, in the first place upon the ground, with handfuls of
stalks laid side by side and knotted together. These are
afterwards plaited into long strips, which are then laid one
above the other, like the flounces of a lady’s dress—&#8203;a comparison
which is further the more appropriate, because the structure
of the frame-work is exactly like a hooped petticoat.</p>

<p>I would not allow the walls of the tokkul, in which I generally
passed my time, to be cemented with clay, partly
because I liked the airiness of the basket-work, and partly
because light was necessary for my daily occupations. There
seemed to me two other advantages—&#8203;first, on dry days, my
goods would more rapidly recover the effect of the wet to
which they had been exposed; and, secondly, I should be less
plagued with rats than those who occupied the plastered huts.
In stormy weather, it is true, I had to suffer a certain amount
of discomfort. To increase my storage-room I contrived
some shelves and stands out of bamboo-canes; I had also
brought from Khartoom some deal planks, expressly for the
manufacture of the tables which were necessary for my botanical
pursuits. A traveller who is in possession of bamboos,
cow-hide, bladder, and clay, will find himself not very inadequately
supplied with representatives of nearly all the building
materials of Europe.</p>

<p>My excursions about the neighbourhood soon began, and
these, with the arrangement of my daily collections, occupied
the greater part of my time. In unfailing good health, I
passed the first few weeks in a transport of joy, literally
enraptured by the unrivalled loveliness of nature. The early
rains had commenced, and were clothing all the park-like
scenery, meadows, trees, and shrubs, with the verdure of
spring. Emulating the tulips and hyacinths of our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
gardens, sprang up everywhere splendid bulbous plants;
whilst amongst the fresh foliage gleamed blossoms of the
gayest hue. The April rains are not continuous, but nevertheless,
trees and underwood were all in bloom, and the grass
was like a lawn for smoothness. In Tropical Africa, after
long continuance of rain, the grass may be considered more
as a defect than an ornament in the landscape: the obstructions
which it interposes to the view of the traveller considerably
mar his enjoyment of the scenery; but throughout the
period of the early rains its growth is remarkably slow, and
it takes some months to attain a height sufficient to conceal
the numerous flowering weeds and bulbs which display their
blossoms at the same season.</p>

<p>The territory of the Dinka includes nearly the whole low
ground, extending right away to the Gazelle. It is a vast
plain of dark alluvial clay, of which the uniformity is not
broken by a single hill or mass of rock, any tracts of forest
being of very limited extent. As they approach the districts
of the Bongo and the Dyoor, the Dinka steppes lose much of
that park-like aspect which they here present. Indeed, very
marked is the contrast in the character of the scenery which
appears on entering those districts; for to the very borders
of the Dinka reaches that enormous table-land of ferruginous
soil which, unbroken except by gentle undulations or by
isolated mounds of gneiss, gradually ascends to the Equator.
This plain appears to cover the greater part of the centre of
the continent, even if it does not extend as far as Benguela
and the shores of the Niger. From my own experience, I
can certify that the general geological features of the soil,
as exhibited as far south as the latitude of 4°, are identical
with those which were conspicuous here, where the latitude
was between 7° and 8° N.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RIVER TONDY.</div>

<p>At the end of a fortnight I made a trip to the south-east,
the first of a series of excursions to Ghattas’s different Seribas,
which lay four or five leagues apart. On this tour I learnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
something of the river Tondy, on which is established the
Seriba known as Addai. The river was now at its lowest
level, and was flowing north-east in a tolerably rapid current,
between precipitous banks fifteen feet in height. In depth
it varied from four to seven feet, and it was about thirty feet
in breadth; in the rainy season, however, for three miles,
the adjacent steppes are covered with its floods, which are
always very prolific in fish. Before the Tondy joins the
Gazelle, as it does in the district of the Nueir, it spreads
irregularly over the low-lying country and leaves its shores
quite undefined. In this way it forms a number of swamps,
all but inaccessible, to which the Dinka, whenever they are
threatened by plundering excursions from the Seribas, lose
no time in driving their herds.</p>

<p>Although the Tondy is nearly as long as the Dyoor, it is
very inferior in its volume of water. Like several of the less
important rivers of this region, it flows for a long distance
without any appreciable increase either in size or speed.
These streams intersect the country and cut it up into
narrow sections, which are rarely designated on the maps.</p>

<p>The second of the Seribas which I visited was called Geer,
and was just four leagues to the south of the chief settlement.
It was surrounded by bamboo-jungles, and was situated in a
prolific corn-valley, watered by a tributary of the Tondy. It
contained about 800 huts, occupied by Bongo, who had settled
there.</p>

<p>The road to Geer, nearly all the way, was over a firm, rocky
soil, through bush forests, swarming with wart-hogs (<i lang="la">Phacochærus</i>).
About three-quarters of a league on the way, stood
a dense mass of lofty trees, not unlike an alder grove. It was
traversed by rain-courses, and surrounded by low swampy
steppes, which in the rainy season are entirely under water.
The wood consisted mainly of tall uncariæ and eugeniæ,
80 feet in height, of which the long, straight stems were
crowned by spreading foliage: it was the first bit of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
primæval forests which fill up the valleys through which flow
the rivers of the Niam-niam. I paid many visits to this
interesting spot; by the people in the Seriba it was termed
Genana, the Arabic word for a garden. In its grateful shade
grew dense thickets of red-blossomed melastomaceæ, intermingled
with giant aroideæ (<i lang="la">Amorphophallus</i>), and bowers
of creepers. The character of the vegetation was in striking
contrast to the other forests of the district, and for the first
time reminded me of the splendour of our northern woods—&#8203;it
was like an enclave of the luxuriant flora of West Africa,
transported to this region of bushes and steppes.</p>

<p>On the adjacent plains herds of giraffes were very frequently
seen. To bring down one of these giraffes was a
matter of but little difficulty. They pace unconcernedly
from bush to bush, taking their choice amidst the varieties of
herbage, and I was surprised to find that it required half-a-dozen
shots before a herd of nearly twenty could be started
into flight; but, once off, there was no gaining upon them,
and, like the fleetest of sailing-vessels, they disappeared on
the horizon. I was on this day treated to the rare delicacy
of a giraffe’s tongue; there was some trouble in finding a dish
on which it could be served, and I suppose that the longest
fish-platter would hardly suffice for the display of this dainty.
I had formerly tasted the flesh in Gallabat, and as I had
abundance of beef in the Seriba, the carcase was distributed
between my bearers. Roast giraffe may be reckoned amongst
the better class of game, and is not unlike veal.</p>

<p>Geer provides the whole neighbourhood with bamboos.
The African species (<i lang="la">Bambusa abyssinica</i>) seems to possess a
character superior to what ordinarily belongs elsewhere to
that useful product of the tropics. It is common on the
lower terraces of Abyssinia and in all the rocky parts of the
Upper Nile district, where the climate is sufficiently moist;
it is found generally on river banks, though but rarely on the
open steppes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FESTIVAL AT SEED-TIME.</div>

<p>The canes grow to a height of thirty or forty feet, and the
stoutest specimens that came under my notice were between
two and three inches in diameter. They are not so swollen
at the joints as the Chinese and Indian sorts; but this is
an advantage, since they are more easily split. Even after
repeated boiling, the young shoots were never eatable.</p>

<p>For two nights and a day whilst I was in Geer, the natives
were abandoning themselves to their wild orgies, which now
for the first time I saw in their full unbridled swing. The
festival was held to celebrate the sowing of the crops; and
confident in the hope that the coming season would bring
abundant rains, these light-hearted Bongo anticipated their
harvest. For the preparation of their beer they encroached
very lavishly on their present corn stores, quite indifferent to
the fact that for the next two months they would be reduced
to the necessity of grubbing after roots and devouring any
chance bird or even any creeping thing that might come in
their way. Incredible quantities of “legyee” were consumed,
so as to raise the party to the degree of excitement necessary
for so prolonged a revel. In honour of the occasion there
was produced a large array of musical instruments, a detailed
account of which shall be given hereafter, but the confusion
of sound beggared the raging of all the elements and made
me marvel as to what music might come to. They danced
till their bodies reeked again with the oil of the butter tree.
Had they been made of india-rubber, their movements could
scarcely have been more elastic; indeed, their skins had all
the appearance of gutta-percha. The whole scene was more
like a fantoccini than any diversion of living beings.</p>

<p>By the end of April the vegetation was so far developed
that I might fairly reckon on a larger botanical collection on
a longer excursion. Accordingly, accompanied by my servants
and a few bearers, I set out towards the west, designing
to visit the Seribas belonging to Kurshook Ali and Agahd,
and to explore the River Dyoor. I was everywhere received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
most hospitably, and thus had every encouragement to make
similar trips amongst the various Seribas. As a rule I did
not produce my letters of introduction to the agents until the
second day, that I might prove whether my welcome was a
mere official service, or was accorded freely and by good-will.
I had never cause to complain: the agents, one and all,
showed me the greatest attention, entertained me handsomely,
and placed at my disposal all that I could desire. Their
courtesy went so far that, although the country was perfectly
safe, they insisted on providing me with a guard of soldiers.
In addition to this, the local governors of the negro villages
always escorted my little caravan from stage to stage. I
found that the whole country was occupied, at intervals of
five or six leagues, with settlements of the Khartoomers, in
their palisaded Seribas. The inhabitants interchange their
visits as freely as any gentlemen in Europe.</p>

<p>On the third day after my start all my bearers, who had
contracted to serve me for a sum which would be represented
by half-a-crown a day, deserted; they were afraid, perhaps
not without cause, that their burdens of pickings and pullings
would daily increase. This little incident, for which I was
quite prepared, had its effect on the remainder of my journey.
I for my part was perfectly agreeable to their desertion,
for I could obtain gratis as many bearers as I required.
Of course, I had nothing to pay the runaways, and was free
from all charges to bearers for the future. In this I had
no compunction, knowing that I had every right to claim the
same assistance and courtesy that is accorded to any ordinary
traveller amongst the Khartoomers’ Seribas, and to have my
baggage conveyed from one place to another.</p>

<p>My people had glorious times in the Seribas. There was
mutton without stint; and whole animals were slaughtered
even for my dogs: to my hungry Khartoomers it was literally
a land flowing with milk and honey. Reserved for me were
all that they considered the greatest delicacies that Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Africa could produce, and in the way of fruit and vegetables
I could not catalogue the variety that was served, from the
sour Pishamin (<i lang="la">Carpodinus acidus</i>) to the horse-bean (<i lang="la">Canavalia</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOO GUROON.</div>

<p>This excursion lasted from the 27th of April to the 13th
of May. After leaving the chief Seriba we proceeded for
about three leagues to the north-west, and arrived, first, at the
Seriba owned by Abderahman Aboo Guroon. In 1860 this
spot was visited by the Marquis Antinori, who, in spite of
many privations, remained there throughout an entire rainy
season. At that time a French hunter, Alexandra Vayssière,
under the protection of the Dyoor chief, Alwal, with whose
sons I made acquaintance, had founded a small settlement.
Vayssière himself, to whose clever pen the <cite lang="fr">Revue des Deux
Mondes</cite> is indebted for some valuable articles on Central
Africa, died the same year on the Gazelle River, falling
a victim to a virulent fever. Aboo Guroon was formerly a
servant of Petherick’s, and had faithfully accompanied that
praiseworthy traveller in his earliest endeavours to penetrate
the Bongo country. He had obtained his name, Aboo Guroon
(father of horned-cattle), from his noted courage and love of
enterprise, and he was renowned amongst the traders as the
first traveller to the Niam-niam.</p>

<p>The governors of the Seribas and the leaders of the Nubian
expeditions may be divided into two classes: of these the
one are hypocritical cowards, always saying their prayers,
and yet always tyrannical to their subordinates; the others
are avowed robbers. Far preferable, beyond a doubt, are the
latter; they treat those weaker than themselves with a
certain amount of generosity, not to say chivalry; to this
class belonged Aboo Guroon. Close to his Seriba we had to
cross the Molmull stream, which was for a long period represented
on maps as an arm of the Dyoor, but I have proved
that it is a collateral stream, which rises in southern Bongoland.
In the rainy season it is 70 feet wide, and is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
passable by swimming, but it was now nothing more than
a series of pools, the intervals of which were marked by
patches of gneiss.</p>

<p>Ten leagues further west flows the Dyoor. Our route in
that direction was in every way tiresome. For four leagues
and a half we traversed a barren steppe, without being able
to obtain so much as a draught of water, and the rough clods
of clay were a continual impediment. We halted for the
night in a small Seriba of Agahd’s, called Dyoor-Awet. It
lies on the summit of the watershed between the Molmull
and the Dyoor, and from the hill towards the west an extensive
view of the latter river is obtained. Being still somewhat
of a novice in Central African travelling, I resolved, in order
to avoid the heat of the day, to take advantage of the moonlight
nights for proceeding on our march. In the dark,
however, my guides and bearers, inexperienced in their work,
lost themselves in such a labyrinth of paths that we were
obliged to halt in an open meadow and make inquiries on all
sides for the proper route. At length we arrived at some
little enclosures of Deemo, a Dyoor chief. The huts were
built on the slope of a small eminence of hornblende, a formation
that I never noticed elsewhere to the south of the
Gazelle; it extended as far as the right bank of the Dyoor,
which, now at its lowest condition, was flowing sluggishly
towards the north through steppes about a league in width.</p>

<p>The sandy river-bed was bounded by clay banks, from 20 to
25 feet in height, the entire thickness of the alluvium of the
valley. The breadth of the bed at this spot was rather more
than 400 feet, but at this season the running water was
reduced to 80 feet wide and 4 feet deep. I was told that
a few days previously the water had been up to a man’s
shoulder, and that the stream would not now fall any lower.
Ten days later, on my return, I crossed the river about three-quarters
of a league to the south, and although I found that
the whole bed was covered, yet its depth was not above three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
or four feet. Heuglin had crossed the Dyoor at a spot about
20 miles north of where I was, and on the 8th of April 1863
he found the stream about 300 paces in width, with a depth
varying from one foot to three.</p>

<p>Among the Bongo and Dyoor alike, the river goes by the
name of “Gueddy,” whilst the Niam-niam, in whose territory
lies the whole of its upper course, call it “Sway.” It is
ascertained to be one of the more important tributaries of the
system of the White Nile. I found its source in Mount
Baginze, in the eastern portion of the Niam-niam country,
in lat. 5° 35´ N., and in almost the same longitude as
that in which it joins the Gazelle; its main course, omitting
the smaller windings, extends over 350 miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN APOSTROPHE.</div>

<p>As we were wading across its clear waters, my servant,
Mohammed Ameen, was suddenly attacked by a sentimental fit
of home-sickness. He has been mentioned before as distinguished
by the nickname of “the swimmer,” and as a former
Reis he was always more interested than anybody else in
river-systems and hydrographical questions. Stopping midway
in the channel, as though lost in contemplation, he
suddenly apostrophised the waters: “Yonder lies Khartoom;
yonder flows the Nile. Pass on, O stream, pass on in peace!
and bear my greeting to the dear old Bahr-el-Nil!” An
Egyptian would have been too stolid to be moved like this
son of Nubia.</p>

<p>The bush-ranges on the opposite shore were enlivened by
numerous herds of hartebeests and leucotis antelopes. I
hurried on in advance of my caravan, hoping to enjoy a good
chase, but my attempt only resulted in a circuitous ramble
and in extreme fatigue. It was not until the middle of the
day that I rejoined my people in a little village of the Dyoor,
and by that time, inexperienced as I was, the heat, the running,
and the fear of losing my way had conspired almost to
deprive me of the use of my senses. The numberless herds
that, without making a stand, continually scampered across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
my path, still further increased my bewilderment. I was far
onwards on my way back when a flock of domestic goats,
startled by the apparition of a stranger came running athwart
my way. They were of a reddish colour, and, had they been
in the midst of a wilderness, might easily be mistaken for the
little bush antelope (<i lang="la">A. madoqua</i>), so common in these parts.
I was just about to send a last despairing shot amongst the
harmless creatures, but discovered my mistake betimes.
When I afterwards related my adventure for the entertainment
of my people, one of them told a similar anecdote of a
previous traveller, who, however, had actually shot a goat,
and when the enraged owner insisted upon compensation,
could not be induced, even in the face of the <i lang="la">corpus delicti</i>, to
acknowledge his error. The man who told this had been
an eye-witness of the affair, and described in the liveliest
manner the contest that had raged over the zoological
character of the hapless goat.</p>

<p>Rather more than a league from the Dyoor, in an irregular
valley sloping towards the river and surrounded by
wooded hills, was situated, but newly built, the chief settlement
of Kurshook Ali. Khalil, the aged governor, received
me most kindly. After the entire destruction of the former
establishment by fire, he had erected in its place quite a model
Seriba. This is depicted in the background of the accompanying
drawing. In front is a majestic khaya-tree, which
in years to come will probably be the sole surviving relic in
the landscape. Several of the most important types of vegetation
are also represented: on the left are the large
candelabra-euphorbia and borassus palms, and on the
right appear the little gardenia trees, of which the fruit
resembles the wild pear or the crab-apple; by the side of
these are two deserted white ant-hills.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Some of my most pleasant reminiscences of African life
are connected with this spot. Here it was that, two years
later, after experiencing the calamity of a fire, I was hospitably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
received, and passed several months in hunting over
the well-stocked environs. In no other Seriba did I ever see
the same order and cleanliness. The store-houses and the
governor’s dwelling stood alone on an open space within the
palisade; around the exterior, at a considerable distance, were
ranged the huts assigned to the soldiers and other dependants.
The unhealthiness of having a crowd of wretched dwellings
huddled together, the contingent danger of fire amongst so
many straw huts, and the disadvantageous lack of space in
case of an attack, all had their effect in inducing Khalil to
make these innovations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH NIAM-NIAM.</div>

<p>On my arrival I was surrounded by a bevy of real Niam-niam,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
who had been conveyed hither by an expedition lately
returned from their country. They stood and gaped at me
and my belongings with far more curiosity than had been
evinced by the stolid natives of the country. Whilst I was
supposed to be listening to the performances of the resident
Bongo on the guitar, it seemed as though these Niam-niam
would never tire of examining my paraphernalia. My watch,
breech-loader, revolver, my clothes, and even my lucifer
matches had to be scrutinised separately. Nothing of equal
wonder had crossed their experience; and what with my
white skin and my appearance altogether, I looked to them
like some being from another world.</p>

<p>Amongst the acquaintances that I made here I must not
forget to mention a speculative slave-trader from Tunis, who
was now making a second journey over Darfoor. He could
speak a little French, and, to the astonishment of every one,
he could read the names upon my maps. He was the most
refined of his calibre that I had ever met, and to me was
a sort of <i lang="la">deus ex machinâ</i>. Whenever I saw him I had
always a vague feeling that he must be some distinguished
explorator in disguise—&#8203;perhaps a Burton or a Rohlfs. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
complexions were alike, our education had been alike, and
so in these distant regions we met like fellow-countrymen.
In an unguarded moment I grasped his hand, drew him
aside, and begged him privately to tell me who he was and
where he came from. His loud laugh of surprise at my
inquiry was quite enough, and in an instant completely
dispelled any illusion on my part.</p>

<p>The fact of meeting a slave-trader from Tunis in this spot
so completely remote corroborates the imputation of an unexpected
extent of the slave trade in Africa. This polished
Tunisian was, to say the least, in many respects superior to
the adventurers who ordinarily come from Darfoor and Kordofan.
Of them nothing can be said too bad. They pursue
their revolting craft under every pretext; coming as fakis or
priests, they make their iniquitous exchanges for that living
ebony which consists of flesh and blood, and, altogether, they
are as coarse, unprincipled, and villanous a set as imagination
can conceive.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to turn from these incarnations of human
depravity to the calm undesecrated quiet of the wilderness
around. Two leagues to the west brought us to the Wow,
a river of inferior magnitude, but which was very charming.
Meandering between rocky slopes, overhung with a rich and
luxuriant foliage, and shadowed at intervals by stately trees,
after a few miles it joins the Dyoor. Its bed, at its full
measure, is 150 feet wide; but when I saw it, on the 1st of
May, it exhibited merely two little rills trickling merrily
over a rough sandy bottom. In proportion to its size it
seemed to retain in the dry season less water than the Dyoor.
It rises in the heart of the Niam-niam country, where it is
called the Nomatilla; as it passes through the Bongo it is
termed the Harey; whilst just above its confluence with the
Dyoor, to which it contributes about a third of its volume,
it goes by the name of the Nyanahm. It divides the people
of the Dyoor into the two tribes of the Gony and the Wow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WOW SERIBA.</div>

<p>On the banks of this, stretched beneath a noble tree, of
which the age far exceeded any tradition of the natives,
I enjoyed a noonday lounge. My dogs were never weary
of awakening the echoes of the forest, which would give
repeated answers to their cries. I was constrained to move
on by the people who had come out to welcome me from the
neighbouring Seriba of Agahd, known simply as Wow, at
a distance of a league and a half to the west. The possessions
of Agahd’s company in this district are much scattered,
and are interspersed amidst the territories belonging to other
merchants. Their subordinate settlements extend far west
into the lands of the Kredy, their expeditions reaching even
to the western frontiers of the Niam-niam.</p>

<p>The further the advance towards the west from the Dyoor,
the more rapid is the increase in the level of the country.
The ascent indicates the progress from the basin of the
Gazelle to the central highland. The Wow Seriba occupied
the centre of a gentle valley sloping towards the west. The
bottom of this valley, at the time of my visit, was traversed
by a marshy strip of meadow, which, in the rainy season,
forms a running brook that flows into the river. A steep
descent of a hundred feet bounds the valley on the south-west.
I was struck by the richness and diversity of the
foliage—&#8203;a peculiarity in this part of Africa, where vegetation
seems very much to run to wood, and develops itself in
bushes and in trees.</p>

<p>Of the trees which adorn the hanging rocks I may mention
a few which are remarkable on account of their fruit.
The Göll of the Bongo bears pods which, in appearance and
in flavour, resemble those of the St. John’s Bread, and on
that account the Nubians, who use the skins as tan, call it
the Caroob. Its wood, like palisander, is carved by the
natives into pretty stools and benches. Then there was the
Oncoba, from which are made the little round tobacco-boxes,
known in the Arabian trade on the Red Sea; and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the <i lang="la">Strychnos edulis</i>, of which the fruit is not unlike a pomegranate,
containing an edible pulp inclosed in a brittle woody
shell. Together with these grew the Ximenia, a shrub
common to the tropics of both hemispheres. The blossoms
of this emit a soft fragrance as of orange flowers, and it bears
a round yellow fruit about the size of a cherry, which is
about as sour as anything in nature. The flavour is like
a citron, and the soft nut-like kernel is eaten with the juicy
pulp. Several kinds of sycamore, apparently of the Egyptian
species, bear edible figs, but they are poor and insipid.
A beverage refreshing as lemonade is prepared from the
great creeper carpodinus. This plant is well known in the
Guinea trade for its produce of caoutchouc. Its globular
fruit (the sour pishamin of the colonists) contains a large
number of kernels embedded in a fibrous pulp; its sourness exceeds
that of the citron. The sarcocephalus, the wild original
of the species that is cultivated in Guinea, does not here
grow larger than a peach; in shape and colour it may be
compared to a strawberry, though in flavour it resembles an
apple: eaten to excess it acts as an emetic. The white
flowers of this Rubiacea smell like orange-blossoms. The
pericarp of the cordyla contains a green honey-pulp, and
that of the detarium a sweetish yellow powder. Many
species of vitex bear an olive-like fruit with a sweet
aromatic flavour; and spondias offer great tempting plums
of a bright yellow, which, however, leave a harshness in the
throat. The ripe berries of the widely diffused vangueria
taste like gingerbread, and this peculiarity, in a certain
sense, belongs to nearly all the edible fruits of Central
Africa: whatever is not sour and astringent, like unripe
gooseberries, is somewhat sweet and dry to the tongue.
With the exception of the plantain (<i lang="la">Musa sapientium</i>), which
has every claim to be considered a native of Equatorial
Africa, all other fruits are either sour and grating on the
palate, or they are sweet with an after sensation of dryness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
The most perfect examples of each of these are the pishamin
and the date; intermediate to them both is the tamarind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUFFALO-HUNTING.</div>

<p>On account of the numerous gnats and gadflies on the
west of the Dyoor, cattle-breeding suddenly ceases, and even
in the Seribas there are found only a few sheep and goats.
On the other hand, wild buffaloes, after being entirely
missing for a long way to the east of the river, now re-appear.
We had not come across any since we entered the region
of the Gazelle, and the first that we now saw were on the
southern frontier of the Bongo territory. Only one kind of
buffalo is known in this part of Africa, but the difference in
the formation of their horns is so remarkable that cows and
bulls appear quite like two distinct animals. In the bulls
the roots of the horns meet at the top of the head, and cover
the whole of the forehead, whilst in the cows they are separated
by nearly the entire width of the brow. The habit of
this animal is different from what is ordinarily found elsewhere;
for in these regions buffalo-hunting is considered by
no means a dangerous sport. After my recent experience
on the White Nile I was surprised to find so many ready,
without hesitation, to accompany me to the chase. For myself
I had rather a dread of the animal, as my predecessor,
Herr von Harnier, had fallen a victim to a wild buffalo,
which had mutilated his body to such a degree that it could
not be recognised.</p>

<p>On the morning after my arrival I had the luck to surprise
a small herd in a swamp. They immediately took to flight,
with the exception of two, a cow and her calf, which looked
about, astonished, after their disturber. I and my companion
fired simultaneously, and we should have secured the sucking
calf, if the swamp had not been in our way.</p>

<p>In flavour, the best parts of the buffalo-meat almost rival
that of a fattened ox: it is tougher and more stringy, but, in
spite of everything, it is juicy and palatable. The flesh of
the tame species of southern Europe is, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
worse than camel’s flesh, and may indeed be pronounced
uneatable.</p>

<p>Gladly I should have extended my tour westward, to the
Kosanga mountain, and as far as the Seribas of Zebehr,
Bizelli, and some others. The agents were always courteous,
and, unencumbered, I could easily have accomplished my
desire; but my botanical collection had largely increased,
and my supply of paper was exhausted, so that I was constrained
to give up my project, and to return. The rapid
development of vegetation, moreover, warned me that I ought
to be back at my quarters in Ghattas’s Seriba before the
beginning of the rains, so that for the whole of the season,
after they had decidedly set in, I might concentrate my energies
on the investigations which were the proper purpose
of my journey. Accordingly, after exploring the immediate
neighbourhood of Wow, I returned at once to Kurshook Ali’s
Seriba, where I spent a few more days in some brief excursions.</p>

<p>Dense still were the woods around the settlement, although
Khalil, in order to obtain arable land, was daily thinning
them by fire. The small depth of soil in these parts, often
barely a foot, is one of the causes of the instability of the
dwellings which are run up on it, and which are also liable
to destruction from worms above and from white ants below.
When the inhabitants are compelled to rebuild, they prefer
to settle on fresh territory—&#8203;they choose virgin soil, and
hence it arises that not only the villages of the natives, but
even whole settlements of the Nubians, are continually
changing their sites. Every place bears the name of the
native chief; when he dies, therefore, the former name
falls into oblivion. In consequence of this, it becomes very
difficult to fix on the maps names and localities, which can
rarely be permanent beyond a period of at most ten years.
The only enduring landmarks are afforded by the water-courses:
ages pass on, and these change but little as they
fulfil their function in the economy of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HARTEBEEST.</div>

<p>The environs of Kurshook Ali’s Seriba abound in every
variety of game. Genets, civets, zebra-ichneumons, warthogs
(Phacochœrus), wild pigs, cats, lynxes, servals, caracals,
and the large family of the antelopes, all find here their home.</p>

 <p class="caption">Central African Hartebeest.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>In this neighbourhood I killed my first hartebeest and
a leucotis antelope. The hartebeest (<i lang="la">Antilope caama</i>) is
common throughout the greater part of the continent, and
varies in its form, its colour, and the shape of its horns,
according to sex, age, and adventitious circumstances. In
zoological collections two specimens are rarely seen exactly
like one another.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Called “karia” by the Bongo and
“songoro” by the Niam-niam, the hartebeest is the most
frequent of all the larger game. It is generally found in small
herds, varying in number from five to ten, its haunts being
chiefly uninhabited tracts of wilderness. In the cultivated
districts it prefers the light bush forests in the vicinity of
rivers, though it is never seen actually in the river valleys.
It takes its midday rest by standing motionless against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
trunks of trees; and by its similarity in hue to the background
which it chooses, it often eludes all observation. Throughout
the rainy season its colour is bright—&#8203;a sort of yellow-brown,
with a belly nearly white; but in the winter it tones down
to a dullish grey. With the exception of the leucotis, its
flesh is the best eating of any game in the country.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The leucotis antelope<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is the species that congregates in
the largest number in any of the districts that have been
hitherto explored. In the dry season they are often seen in
the wadys in large herds, varying from 100 to 300 head;
during the rains they resort to the more elevated forests.
That is their pairing time, and they divide into smaller
groups. These graceful animals have the same habit as the
South African spring-bok; running at full speed, with
outspanned legs, they often bound four and five feet high,
and jump clean over one another. The female, which has no
horns, in colour and size very much resembles the yalo
(<i lang="la">A. arundinacea</i>), but it can be easily distinguished by the
hair on the metatarsus being black, while in the yalo it is
grey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WATERPOOLS IN THE RED ROCK.</div>

<p>Throughout the whole of this neighbourhood are numerous
plains of ferruginous swamp-ore; only in the rainy seasons,
when the rainfall is at its height, are these covered at all
with grass, which at its best, compared to the luxuriant vegetation
around, is a meagre down, hardly equal to our poorest
pasture lands. On this plateau the rains of March and April
begin to fill the numerous clefts and chasms; the pools thus
formed contain a variety of interesting water-plants, which
disappear completely when the waters again subside. Whereever
the red rock is exposed, its surface is adorned by the
rosy blossoms of the dianthera, a species of capparis, which
here supplies the place of our viscous catch-fly and cuckoo-flower.
Nowhere in the exuberant tropics are we more
vividly reminded of our own scenery than in such spots as
these, where, on the edge of woody precipices and surrounded
by the smiling green of the sward, gleam these gay patches
of dianthera. The naked stone covered by a low detached
overgrowth, in picturesque grouping, rivalled all that I had
ever seen. The gardenia trees fill the air with the fragrance
as of a bower of orange blossoms and jasmine.</p>

<p>The month of May here, as in Europe, is a month of
flowers, amongst which the world of butterflies pass their
ephemeral existence. As a rule, these lepidoptera were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
larger nor more diversified in form and colour than the European,
but, in their aggregate, they were full of beauty. The
dews of night were not sufficient for their thirst, and in
motley masses they assembled round every puddle to enjoy
the precious moisture. By a skilful swing of the butterfly-net
I could catch a hundred at a time. They continue to
swarm in this way till the beginning of July. At times I
saw them thronging all amongst the foliage, and giving to
many a plant the appearance of being covered with the most
variegated blossoms; the bare rock, though destitute of vegetation,
became as charming as a blooming meadow. The
quantities of butterflies in this district are very large in comparison
to what are found in the northern regions of Africa at
this season.</p>

<p>Two leagues to the south of the new Seriba was the site of
the one which had been burnt. But few vestiges remained,
for nature here soon effaces what fire may have spared. The
only surviving evidence of its ever having been the resort of
men was a thriving grove of plantains (<i lang="la">Musa sapientum</i>).
The shoots had been introduced from the Niam-niam lands. In
the meagre households of the Nubians, fruits and vegetables
are hardly considered necessaries; indolence and distaste for
work cause the gardens to be much neglected. By my own
experience, I have found that all garden produce of the
southern regions can be cultivated here at the outlay of very
little attention. The plantain bears fruit within eighteen
months of its first sprouting.</p>

<p>Copious is the river as it flows by the place, shaded
by magnificent afzelia, filæa, and syzygium. The impenetrable
jungles of bamboo, which extend on either
side, are the abode of a large number of bear-baboons. It
was in vain that for some hours I pursued one after another
of these bellowing brutes: immediately they became aware
of my approach, they were knowing enough to quit their exposed
positions on the trees and conceal themselves amidst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the waving grass. The jungle swarmed, too, with great warthogs
(<i lang="la">Phacochærus</i>), which appear as ineradicable as the wild
boars of Europe. The chase of these had small attraction
for me, aware as I was of the extreme unsavouriness of their
flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RAPHIA VINIFERA.</div>

<p>On my way back to the Seriba I made a slight detour, in
order to visit the village of the Dyoor chief Okale. This
lies to the east, upon a small stream, the banks of which are
shadowed by some splendid woods that display the glories of
the Niam-niam wilderness. It was like an enclave of the south
transported to the bushwoods of the north. I looked here
that I might discover the palm-tree, which the Khartoomers
call the Nakhl-el-Faraoon (or Pharaoh’s date-palm), and of
which they had given a wonderful description that roused my
curiosity. I soon satisfied myself that they really meant the
<i lang="la">Raphia vinifera</i>, which grows far and wide throughout tropical
Africa, although probably, in this direction, this may be its
limit. A considerable number of the trees and plants characteristic
of the Niam-niam lands occurred to me in my rambles,
and amongst them the blippo (<i lang="la">Gardenia malleifera</i>), with the
inky sap of which the Niam-niam and the Monbuttoo delight
to dye themselves.</p>

<p>Whether we advanced through villages or hamlets, we
always found the overseers in their full state. Their official
costume was everywhere a long chintz shirt. From their
sparkling eyes beamed forth the delight with which they
regarded my appearance, doubtless to them singular enough.
Most readily they admitted me to every corner of their
households, whence I procured one curiosity after another, and
what I could not carry away I copied into my sketch-book.</p>

<p>Although I could not manage, in the course of an excursion
not occupying three weeks, to traverse the entire
district of the Dyoor, I nevertheless very much increased
my familiarity with their habits, of which I will conclude
this chapter with a concise account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Dyoor is a name assigned by the Dinka, and is synonymous
with men of the woods, or wild men. This designation is a
name of contempt, and is intended to imply the condition
of poverty, in which, according to Dinka ideas, the Dyoor
spend their existence. Of course, it refers to their giving
their sole attention to agriculture, to their few goats and
poultry, and to their disregard of property in cattle. They
speak of themselves as Lwoh. They use the Shillook
dialect unaltered except in a few expressions which they
have adopted, and are anxious to claim a northern origin,
specifying their progenitors as O-Shwolo, or Shillooks. The
area of their territory is quite small, and their number
cannot exceed 20,000 souls.</p>

<p>On the north they are bounded by the numerically large
tribe of the Dembo and some smaller kindred clans. Eighty
miles to the south of them, but separated by the entire width
of the Bongo country, reside the Belanda, a tribe of which
the customs are modified by their intercourse with the Bongo,
but which still make use, with very minor differences, of the
Shillook dialect. These Belanda are partly under the surveillance
of the Niam-niam king Solongho, and partly tributary
to the intruders from Khartoom.</p>

<p>The chequered map of Africa suggests to every reflective
mind many considerations as to how any advance in civilisation
can be possible. There is an utter want of wholesome
intercourse between race and race. For any member of a
tribe which speaks one dialect to cross the borders of a tribe
that speaks another is to make a venture at the hazard of
his life. Districts there are, otherwise prosperous in every
way, which become over-populated, and from these there are
emigrations, which entail a change of pursuits, so that cattle-breeders
become agriculturists and agriculturists become
hunters living on the chase; districts again there are which
shelter the remnant of a people who are resisting oppression
to the very verge of despair; and there are districts, moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
which have been actually reduced to a condition of
vassalage and servitude; but the case is here altogether
without example of a district which, whatever be its other
fluctuations, has ever submitted to a change of race or of
tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DYOOR DECORATIONS.</div>

<p>Former travellers, although they have found their way to
the Dyoor without concerning themselves with the origin
of the people, appear to have made the observation that
their complexion is a shade lighter than that of the Dinka.
For my part I am convinced that this is so; not that I
should feel justified in insisting upon this token as showing
a difference between Dinka and Shillooks. Probably, the
colour of the skin of the Dyoor loses something of its darker
hue from their living in the shadows of their woodlands;
but this is a question which involves meteorological and
geographical considerations which are beyond our grasp.</p>

<p>In spite of their intercourse for many years, and their
partial dependence upon the Dinka, the Dyoor have not
departed from the Shillook mode of decorating themselves.
Just on the extreme borders a few may every now and then
be found imitating the radial stripes upon the foreheads;
but it is quite uncommon for either sex to tattoo themselves.
Neither does their daily familiarity with the Nubians induce
them to adopt a modest dress. They only wear round the
back of their loins a short covering of leather, something
like the skirts of an ordinary frock coat; a calfskin
answers this purpose best, of which they make two tails to
hang down behind. Anything like the decorations of the
hair which have excited our wonder amongst the Shillook
and the Dinka is here totally rejected, and the Dyoor, men
and women alike, have their hair close cropped.</p>

<p>The favourite ornaments of the men very much resemble
those of the Dinka, consisting of a collection of iron rings
below the elbow and a huge ivory ring above the elbow.
One decoration peculiar to themselves consists of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
heavy circlets of molten brass, which are very elaborately
engraved. Brass, as known amongst the people, is called
“damara,” and is about thrice the value of copper; it
had been introduced into their traffic long before the arrival
of any Khartoomers, having been brought as an article of
commerce by the Dembo, who, as neighbours of the Baggara,
were led into business relations alike with Kordofan and
Darfoor on the one hand, and with the northern negroes on
the other. Our fine metals, one and all, were quite unknown
amongst them.</p>

<p>Their women, too, in hardly any respect differ from the
Dinka women; like them burdening the wrists and ankles
with a cluster of rings. Very frequently one great iron ring
is thrust through the nose, the hole to admit it being bored
indifferently through the base, the bridge, or the nostrils.
The rims of the ears also are pierced to carry an indefinite
number of rings. These deformities are especially characteristic
of the Bellanda, who sometimes attach to their nose
a dozen rings at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GLASS BEADS.</div>

<p>One of the iron decorations which is most admired, and
which is found far away right into the heart of Africa, I first
saw here amongst the Dyoor; I mean the iron beads or perforated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
little cylinders of iron, strung together. These
have some historical interest attached to them in connection
with the development of trade in Africa, arising from the fact
that they were earlier in use than glass beads, to which they
must be compared. Glass beads, obviously, were only brought
into the market after it had been proved that the natives
would be willing to wear ornaments like in form but of a
lighter material than the hard metal which they were wont
to forge into shape piece by piece. The Japanese and other
inhabitants of Eastern Asia are known to trick themselves
out in steel beads, thus evidencing their long exclusion from
all intercourse with Europe. In the Soudan these strings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
beads were principally made at Wandala, and Barth has
specially noticed them at Marghi. Every tribe which I
visited in proceeding inland from the Gazelle I found to
retain the preference for beads made of iron.</p>

<p>The derivation of the stock from a negro race of the nobler
kind, and one which has a small development of jaw, such as
the Shillook, may be fairly understood from the accompanying
portrait. The sitting figure is a likeness which I took at my
leisure of one of my bearers. I thought it would illustrate
the graceful slimness of the limbs, which nevertheless are all
in due proportion. It may serve, too, in a degree to exemplify
the appropriateness of the expression “swamp-man,”
which I have several times employed, and moreover may help
to justify the comparison which has likened them to a bird.</p>

<p>In recent times they have lost some of their ancient habits.
For instance, the practice of mutual spitting, which was long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the ordinary mode of salutation, has fallen into desuetude.
Throughout the entire period of my residence in Africa I
was never a witness of it more than three times: and in all
these cases the spitting betokened the most affectionate
goodwill; it was a pledge of attachment, an oath of fidelity;
it was to their mind the proper way of giving solemnity to a
league of friendship.</p>

<p>The spot which the Dyoor inhabit is the inferior terrace of
the ferruginous formation in the district. The consequence
is that they are quite at home with all iron work. The
Dinka, although they do not settle down close to them,
because of the hostility of the Bongo, yet are glad to welcome
the Dyoor, in order to avail themselves of their aid in
getting at the iron, which would otherwise be unsecured. It
might almost be said that every Dyoor is a smith by profession.
The result of their toil, however, does not so much
find its way to the underground stores of the Dinka as to
the magazines of the Khartoom merchants.</p>

Throughout the whole district of the Upper Nile these
answer all the purpose of our current coin. Although the
superficial veins of iron ore, for hundreds of miles, do not
differ much in their appearance, there are only certain
localities which produce an ore that, under the primitive
mode of smelting, yields a remunerative supply of genuine
metal. One of these prolific veins is found in the proximity
of Kurshook Ali’s Seriba. With a perseverance for which I
could not have given them credit, the natives have dug out
trenches some ten feet deep, from which they have obtained
a material very like our roe-stone. Considerable quantities
of red ochre are discovered, but they are not turned to any
account, through ignorance of a proper way of manipulation.</p>

<p>Just before the commencement of seed-time, in March,
the Dyoor make a general move away from their huts, partly
for the purpose of dragging the rivers for fish, and partly to
busy themselves with iron-smelting in the woods. In the
shaded centre of a very wooded spot they construct their
furnaces of common clay, making them in groups, sometimes
as many as a dozen, according to the number of the party.
Their wives and children accompany them, and carry all
their movables. In the midst of the wilderness, otherwise
so desolate, they form a singular picture. The stems of the
trees gleam again with their lances and harpoons; on the
branches hang the stout bows ready for the buffalo hunt;
everywhere are seen the draw-nets, hand-nets, snares and
creels, and other fishing-tackle. There is a mingled collection
of household effects, consisting of gourd-shells, baskets,
dried fish and crocodile, game, horns, and hides. On the
ground lie piles of coals, of ore, of cinders, and of dross.
Petherick, the first explorer of this Dyoor district, has given
a very accurate account of their primitive method of smelting
iron, so that I may be repeating in a degree what has
been related before: many things, however, there are which
appeared to me under a somewhat different aspect.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<div class="sidenote">DYOOR SMELTING FURNACE.</div>

<p>The smelting-furnace is a cone, not more than four feet
high, widening at the top into a great goblet shape. So
little deviation was there in the form of any that I saw that
all seemed to me to be erected on precisely the same model.
One obstacle to the construction of larger furnaces is the
extreme difficulty of preventing the mass of clay from
cracking in the process of drying. The cup-shaped aperture
at the top communicates by a very small throat with the
cavity below, which is entirely filled with carbons. Into the
upper receiver are thrown fragments of ore, of about a solid
inch, till it is full. The hollow tunnel extends lower than
the level of the ground; and the melted mass of iron, finding
its way through the red-hot fuel, collects below in a pile
of slag. At the base there are four openings: one of these is
much larger than the others, and is used for the removal
of the scoriæ; the other three are to admit the long tewel-irons,
which reach to the middle of the bottom, and keep
the apertures free for the admission of air. Without stoking,
the openings would very soon become blocked up with slag.
In reply to my inquiry I was told that bellows are never
employed; it was said that too fierce a fire was injurious,
and caused a loss of metal. A period of a day and a half, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
about forty hours, is requisite to secure the product of one
kindling. When the flames have penetrated right through
the mass of ore until they rise above it, the burning is
presumed to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Amongst the Bongo the furnaces are different, being
generally constructed in three compartments, and fitted with
bellows. They also place layers of ore and fuel alternately.</p>

<p>The deposit of metal and fuel is heated a second time,
and the heavy portion, which is detached in little leaflets
and granules, is once more subjected to fire in crucibles of
clay. The particles, red-hot, are beaten together by a great
stone into one compact mass, and, by repeated hammering,
are made to throw off their final dross. Nearly half of the
true metal is scattered about during the progress of the
smelting, and would be entirely lost if it were not secured
by the natives. In regard to its homogeneousness and its
malleability, the iron procured in this way is quite equal to
the best forged iron of our country.</p>

<p>The Dyoor and the Bongo appear almost equally ignorant
about charcoal-burning. They understand very little about
the exclusion of air from the furnaces, or of burning their
wood in piles: their science seems limited to the combustion
of small fragments heaped up over one another till the fire
below them is choked, or subdued by pouring water upon the
top. I am not aware whether the other negroes have
mastered the secret of charcoal-making; but if what has
been said about the Dyoor holds good about Africa in
general, it accounts at once for the remarkable fact that in
spite of the abundance of the crude material, iron is so little
employed. There is a universal absence of lime, so that
stone erections are quite unknown.</p>

<p>If a comparison might be instituted, I should say that in
Africa iron might be estimated to have a value about equivalent
to copper with us, whilst the worth of copper would
correspond to that of silver.

<div class="sidenote">DYOOR HUTS.</div>

<p>For fifteen years have the Nubians now been brought into
contact with this region, but they have never taught the
natives either the way of making bricks or any intelligent
conception of the use of charcoal. Themselves too lazy to
improve the treasures which a bountiful Nature has flung
amongst them, they are too idle and too indifferent to stimulate
even the people they have subjugated to put forth any
energy at all. And this is but one proof out of many of the
demoralising tendency of Islamism, which would ever give a
retrograde movement to all civilisation.</p>

<p>Throughout Africa I have never come across a tribe that
has not adopted a mode of building huts which, alike with
respect to exterior and interior, is not peculiar to itself.
The huts of the Dyoor do not resemble the mushroom shapes
of the Shillooks, nor are they like the substantial huts of the
Dinka, massive and distinguished by small outbuildings and
porches. Again, they could not for a moment be mistaken
to be dwellings of the Bongo, because they have no straw
projections about the top of the roof. In a general way
they are a yet more simple and unadorned construction—&#8203;not
that they are destitute of that neat symmetry which seems
to belong to all negro dwellings. The roof is a simple
pyramid of straw, of which the section is an equilateral
triangle, the substructure being all of wickerwork, either
of wood or bamboo, and cemented with clay.</p>

<p>Inside every hut there is a large receptacle for storing
whatever corn or other provision is necessary for the household.
These are made of wickerwork, and have a shape like
great bottles. To protect them against the rats, which never
fail to carry on their depredations, they are most carefully
overdaubed with thick clay. They occupy a very large proportion
of the open space in the interior; very often
they are six or seven feet in height, and sometimes are
made from a compound of chopped stubble and mud. After
the huts have been abandoned, and all else has fallen into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
decay, these very frequently survive, and present the appearance
of a bake-oven gone to ruin. In the Arabic of the
Soudan this erection is called a “googah.” It is derived
from the Dinka; the huts of the Bongo and the Niam-niam
having nothing of the sort, because they build detached
granaries for their corn.</p>

<p>The picture which is here introduced is a representation
of the rural pursuits of this peaceful tribe. It is presumed
to be winter time, when, for some months to come, no rain
is to be expected. It may be taken as illustrating what
might be witnessed at any time between October and April.
The tall erections adjacent to the huts contain the various
grain requisite for the next seed time, and may be supposed
to be full of the sorghum, the maize, and the gourd.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It is
better to let these be exposed to the sun rather than to run
the risk of having them devoured by rats or vermin in the
huts. Underneath these structures the goats are hid; besides
these, dogs and some poultry are the only domestic animals
they keep.</p>

<p>The open space in front of the huts consists of a plain,
most carefully levelled by treading it down. Upon this floor,
which is perfectly hard, the corn is winnowed; and it serves
as a common area for all domestic purposes. In front of the
huts, too, sunk to some depth below the ground, there is
a great wooden mortar, in which the corn, after it has been
first pounded by the primitive African method of stones, is
reduced to a fine meal by rubbing with the hands. The
Dinka also use these sunken mortars, which are hewn out
of some hard wood; but the Bongo and Niam-niam carry
with them movable mortars of a smaller size.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DYOOR PURSUITS.</div>

<p>To the right may be observed a man, who is collecting iron
ore, and one of the wicker baskets which belong to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
reserve of corn. Great gongs hang upon the posts towards
the left, and some of the massive bows, of which the strings
are ready stretched by a billet to serve as snares. This
artifice is employed by several of the people of this district
to facilitate their chase of the wild buffaloes. Very strong
straps of hide are strained across the tall grass of the lowlands,
where the buffaloes congregate. One end is fastened
either to a tree or to a peg driven into the ground, the other
end attached to the bow. This forms a kind of noose which,
through the rebound of the billet, tightens itself about the
legs of the buffalo when it strains it. The startled beast
makes a bound, and is immediately fettered. The hunters,
who had been lying in wait, seize this moment and, with their
lances, strike at the prey, which, if not utterly entangled,
is sure by the bow to be obstructed in its running. In a
similar way all the larger antelopes are captured, especially
the powerful eland, at which it is hard to get, even after it
has been driven to the marshy levels.</p>

<p>Good large families have the Dyoor; and were it not that
the Nubians come upon the land, and every year carry off at
least half the corn that is grown, there would long ago have
been, as with their kindred on the White Nile, a dense
Dyoor population. They partake also of the skilfulness of
the Shillooks in obtaining resources for livelihood in various
ways: they pursue the chase, they practise fishing when they
have the chance; they are industrious in tillage; they
thoroughly appreciate the value of cattle, and would like to
possess it, although in their new settlement they can boast
little more than a few kids and goats. To have a well-stocked
poultry-yard, and to possess that friend of man, a
good dog, is essential to the satisfaction of a Dyoor household.
Upon these the attention of the men is centred, and
on these they make their largest outlay. If they escape
servitude to the Nubians, and are not obliged to turn porters
to convey their burdens, or builders to erect their dwellings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
they employ themselves with their fishing and hunting, or in
practising the art of Tubal Cain. Labour in the fields is all
done by the women, upon whom also falls the entire domestic
superintendence as well as the actual work of the house;
they make all the wickerwork and do all the manipulation
of the clay; they trample down the level floor and mould
the vessels of every size. It is remarkable how they manage
with the mere hand to turn out immense vessels which, even
to a critical eye, have all the appearance of being made on
a wheel. In order to render a clay floor perfectly level and
free from cracks they work in a very original way. They
procure from the woods a piece of tough bark, about three
feet long; they then kneel down upon the clay, and persevere
in patting it with their pieces of bark till they make
the surface of the soil as smooth as though it had been rolled.
In a very similar way they prepare the graves for their dead,
which they arrange very close to their huts. A circular
mound, some three or four feet high, indicates the situation of
the last resting-place of a Dyoor so long as the violence of the
rain allows it to retain its shape; but a very few years suffice
to obliterate the final vestiges of these transient memorials.</p>

<p>Affection for parents and for children is developed amongst
the Dyoor much more decidedly than in any other Central
African tribe which I have known. In a way that I have
not observed among other pagan negroes, they place their
infants in long baskets that answer the purpose of cradles.
There is a kind of affection which even brutes can display to
their offspring as well as human beings. In the very lowest
grades of human society there is ever a kind of bond which
lasts for life between mother and child, although the father
may be a stranger to it. Such, to say the least, is the measure
of affection which the Dyoor show to their little ones.
Nor is this all; they have a reverence for age; and in every
hamlet there are grey heads amongst them.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I was</span> again in Ghattas’s Seriba on the 13th of May. The
arrival of an ivory caravan on its return journey had brought
an unwonted animation. But for me very soon the ordinary
routine of life came back, and one day passed on just like
another in the closest intercourse with Nature. Except
during some temporary excursions to the Bongo, this Seriba
would be my residence for some months to come, and I set
to work to make my quarters as comfortable as I could in a
good-sized hut which had been vacated for me.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to lay out a large vegetable
garden, a task which engaged not only all my own people,
but gave occupation to not a few of the black slaves of the
place. I had not only brought with me a good supply of
pickaxes and spades, but I had likewise a capital collection
of seeds. Thus I hoped at once to provide for my own
necessities, and to prove to the natives the productiveness of
their soil. The plot of ground was nearly 200 paces square,
and the next thing was to enclose it with a hedge of straw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and to lay it out with a series of parallel beds. The larger
number of these beds I planted with the best sorts of maize,
of which I had procured the original ears from New Jersey.</p>

<p>Seventy days after sowing I reaped the crop, and the ingathering
did not simply answer ray highest expectations,
but surpassed in quality the original stock; the kinds which
seemed to succeed best being those which after they are dry
are horny and transparent.</p>

<p>Tobacco from Maryland grew to an immense height, and
I gathered several hundredweights of it. There was not
altogether so much of a deficiency of tobacco in the country
as of the larger leaves, of which use could be made for rolling
into cigars. In Egypt the Virginian tobacco can be made
to grow leaves as large as the palm of one’s hand, but in
the negro districts the whole produce is quite diminutive.
Negroes always sow tobacco under cover before they plant it
out; the midday sun of Central Africa is too powerful for
the seed, which infallibly perishes in a parched soil. I had
always to guard against the same difficulty with all my
European vegetables, especially in July, or at other times,
when five or six days without a drop of rain would come in
succession, and I only saved my young sprouts by having
water brought twice a day by the women in their great
pitchers. Worms did a vast amount of mischief amongst the
germinating seeds, and no devastator was more destructive
than the great millipede (<i lang="la">Spirostreptus</i>), which, as long and
thick as my finger, penetrated the soil in every direction.
The havoc made in this way amongst the beans before they
were set was very considerable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GARDEN VEGETABLES.</div>

<p>The hard, yet fertile soil, I feel certain, is quite suited for
our cucumbers, cabbage, turnip-cabbage, and radishes. Of
radishes, the European sort succeeds better than the Egyptian,
which belongs to quite an anomalous variety. Melons
and water-melons can only be ripened during the winter
months, when they are artificially protected and supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
with moisture. Any attempt to grow them in the rainy
season always results in failure; either the fruit is eaten by
worms long before it is mature, or the leaves are devoured
by grubs. Here, too, I trained some tomatoes and sunflowers,
which ever since have been quite naturalised in this part of
Africa. Had my sojourn been longer, I should have made
an attempt at establishing the plantain, of which indeed I
saw some isolated plants now and then in the Seriba. This
is a natural production of the land of the Niam-niam; it
would doubtless thrive here, but the indolence of the Nubians
is so great, and their indifference towards all produce that
must be gained by toil is so indomitable, that garden culture
amongst them remains fitful and unprogressive.</p>

<p>When I had seen all the labours of the kitchen-garden
complete, I was free to abandon myself to the full delights
of the flora. Up with the sun, I used to take one or two of
my people with me to carry my portfolios and my arms, and
in the safe proximity of the Seriba I explored the woods for
hours together, returning about noon with a whole treasury
of floral wealth. My table at meals never failed to be well
supplied, and I was treated as bountifully as in Africa I
could be. I enjoyed sitting in the shade of some spreading
tree, while I proceeded to analyse, to classify, and to register,
the various novelties which I was perpetually finding. Later
in the day I was in the habit of wandering out alone over
the plains, whilst my servants at home busied themselves in
renewing the paper for my <i lang="la">hortus siccus</i>, and in pressing out
the plants afresh. This labour of the day was often carried
on till quite late at night: it was repeated so often that my
collection increased to a very considerable extent; roll was
piled up after roll; everything most carefully stitched up in
hides ready to go along with me on my farther journey, and
to be carried across deserts and seas until they could finally
be deposited in the magazines of science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BASTARD GEMSBOK.</div>

<p>One of these rambles into the woods led to a singular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
hunting adventure, which could only occur in Central Africa.
I had been sitting crouched up for half an hour or more
under the shade of a butter-tree, in the midst of some tall
grass, and, engaged in the dissection of my plants, I had quite
forgotten where I was. My three attendants were enjoying,
as they were accustomed, a peaceful doze; stillness reigned
so supreme in the solitude that one could almost hear the
tread of every emmet on the soil, as backwards and forwards
it hurried to the laboratory within its hill. All at once a
huge shadow came in sight, and looking up I saw, just within
pistol-range, the great form of a buck antelope. I was struck
as much with admiration as with surprise: the creature had
seemed to come suddenly from the earth. My heart fluttered
at the apparition, but I could not be otherwise than sensible
of its beauty. It was a specimen of the bastard gems-bok
(<i lang="la">Antilope leucophæa</i>). Except on the belly, which was
white, its long hair was all of a brownish grey. It carried its
head erect; its ears were long and pointed; its horns massive
and very long; its black legs going off into white fetlocks.
A stiff mane of bright brown crested its curved neck,
and reached to its withers. It had a tail like the giraffe, with
which it wisped off the flies—&#8203;a tuft of hair of about nine
inches in length appended to a long slim stem. There it
stood, majestically, I might say, like a stately buffalo when
it surveys the region all around before it trusts itself to feed.
There it stood, in an attitude at once commanding and defiant.
Whenever it moved the grass crackled beneath its
tread, and ere long it shifted its place again and turned
its full face towards me. I cautiously reached out my hand
for a rifle that was lying near me, pushed back the guard,
and, at the next movement of the beast, hit it with a ball
right upon the shoulder-blade from a distance of about
twenty paces. The creature reared itself up, then paused
an instant, staggered, and let its head sink down as if amazed.
I was just about to get hold of a second rifle when there came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
a sudden crash, and, while I was still sitting, the animal had
fallen just beyond the open portfolio which was lying outspread
before me. Fortune had thus cast the noble prey
right into my clutches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <img src="images/i_217.jpg"
 alt="Gemsbok">
 <p class="caption">Central African Bastard Gemsbok (<i lang="la">Antilope leucophæa</i>).</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The sound of the rifle had hardly aroused my people, for
this is a country where a stray shot does not attract attention
for an instant; but my shout of surprise and delight
brought them quickly to their feet. Some negroes were
soon fetched from the neighbouring huts, who quickly
completed the work of flaying and jointing the prey. Its
head alone weighed 35 pounds. The natives informed me
that the Mahnya (as the Bongo call this species of antelope)
are among the rarest animals of the district, although they
live as much in one quarter as another. They are ordinarily
found singly and far separate from any other of their kindred
race; and it is said that the largest of them will assail a
huntsman, and are as furious when angry as a wild buffalo.</p>

<p>For a long time I was sorely depressed by the loss of my
trusty Arslan, who had been with me ever since I left
Berlin and had reached the remote wilderness. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
accompanied me through all the hardships of travel; and
here I hoped that all dangers were passed, and now that
the heat of the desert and the privations of water had been
overcome, I had no fear of losing him; but he sank a
victim to the treachery of the climate. My dog had seemed
to me almost the last link that bound me to my home, and
when I lost him I felt as though a bridge had been broken
down which connected me with my native soil. It would
have been a grief to me to lose my dog anywhere, but to
lose him here was doubly sorrowful—&#8203;here, amongst circumstances
where he more than ever replaced the lack of a
friend.</p>

<p>Nature, pure and free, must ever be a great consoler
amidst all the disappointments of life. The stillness and
peace of the plant-world brought ease to my troubled mind.
To that world, as I turned then, I may be permitted to
return now.</p>

<p>Nothing could more completely witness to the great
variety of vegetation in my immediate neighbourhood than
the fact that during my residence of five months I made
a collection of almost 700 flowering plants, which I duly
classified. It would not be possible in Europe during a
whole year to gather so large a number if one were limited
to the environs of a single town. From my own experience
I am satisfied that, notwithstanding all means of intercommunication,
it would be beyond the power of a botanist
to secure anything like 500 species in an entire season.
This would arise very much from his having to change his
position, and from the varying time at which plants come
into bloom: but here, in the land of the Dyoor and the
Bongo, Flora seems to delight in crowding all her profusion
upon the earlier months of the rainy period: the
autumn is left comparatively barren, and even at the height
of the rains there is little to be found which was not already
in perfection some time before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WOODLANDS.</div>

<p>The land itself seems decidedly less varied than in the
most uniform districts of Germany. Woods indeed there
are, and steppes; there are low grassy pastures and shrubby
thickets; there are fields and coppices; there are marshes
and pools; there are bare rocky flats, and occasionally a
rocky declivity; very rarely, and only in the dry, out-drained
river-beds, are sands to be met with; and from these ordinary
characteristics there is little or no deviation.</p>

<p>The features of the woodlands are, however, very diversified.
There are trees which run up to a height varying
from 30 to 40 feet, and these alternate with dwarf shrubs
and compact underwood. Many of the fields are marked by
single trees, which stand quite apart, and which have been
intentionally preserved by the natives because of their
edible fruit. In some places there are low-lying grassy
flats, which in the rainy months are quite impassable, because
the grass grows taller than a man; whilst in others
the grass is stunted, because there is but a thin layer of
soil to cover the rock below, and consequently vegetation
is comparatively weak. As to the pasture-lands, they seem
to be interrupted every here and there with bushy and
impenetrable thickets, which are either grouped around
some isolated trees or luxuriate about some high white ant-hill.
In the shade of these are found the splendid bulbs
of the Hæmanthus, Gloriosa, Clorophytum, together with
Aroideæ, ground-orchids, and the wonderful Kosaria. Upon
the drier spots within the forests, or where the clay-soil
happens to be mixed with sand, weeds and herbaceous plants
are found which recall the flora of the northern steppes.
Amongst these are the Capparideæ, which (existing as they
do in the south of Nubia) make good their claim to be a
bond of union between the two zones. Pressing further
into the thickets which are formed in the forests, we come
across great trees so thickly bound by the wonderful foliage
of the large creeper Carpodinus, that a ray of sunlight can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
never pass them. Here, too, are wild vines of many a kind,
the festoons of which are further burdened as they hang by
Dioscoriæ and Asclepiads.</p>

<p>Many are the comparisons that might be made by way
of analogy between the numerous trees of this delightfully
wooded district and those of our own home. Some of the
trees at first sight have a considerable likeness to our
common oaks: amongst these may be named both the
Terminalia and the butter-tree (<i lang="la">Bassia</i> or <i lang="la">Buterospermum</i>).
The fruit of the latter consists of a globular oily kernel,
which looks something like a horse-chestnut, and which is as
large as a good-sized apricot, and is enveloped in a green
rind. This envelope can be kept till it is as enjoyable as
a medlar, and is considered one of the chief fruits of the
country. From the kernels of this widely-known tree an
oil is expressed, which, under the name of “butter of Galam,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
is a recognised article of commerce in Gambia; it has an
unpleasant flavour, which makes it not at all a desirable
adjunct to the table, and so, for us, it has but an insignificant
value; its most valuable property is that, at a temperature
of 68° Fahr., it becomes as solid as tallow. The tree itself
is very handsome, having a bark which is regularly marked
by polygonal rifts in its surface, and which permits it to be
likened to an oak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRUCTIFEROUS TREES.</div>

<p>A very common tree, which bears a somewhat striking
resemblance to our white beech, is the small-leaved Anogeissus.
Nut-trees are here replaced by Kigelia and Odina.
Far spread as are trees of the character of our oak, so too
we may say are trees which have the look of a horse-chestnut.
Of this kind is the <i lang="la">Vitex Cienkowskii</i>, with others
of the species, of which the sweet olive-shaped fruit is
gathered as assiduously by the natives as by the wart-hogs,
who relish it exceedingly. Another favourite fruit is the
produce of the <i lang="la">Diospyros mespiliformis</i>. The plane-tree
may here be said to be represented, equally with respect to
its bark, its foliage, and the pattern of its leaves, by the
splendid <i lang="la">Sterculia tomentosa</i>, which has established itself
pretty generally throughout Tropical Africa. In the place
of willows Africa offers the Anaphrenium; and over and over
again the traveller may fancy that he sees the graceful locust-tree.
The Parkia is another of those imposing trees which
are met with; the leaves of this are not unlike the Poinciana,
which is known also as the Poincillade or Flamboyer:
its flowers are a fiery red with long stamens, and hang in a
tuft; when they die off they leave a whole bundle of pods,
a foot in length, in which the seeds are found covered with a
yellow dust. The Bongo, as indeed do the Peulhs of Footah
Dyalon in West Africa, mix this mealy dust with their flour,
and seem to enjoy it, but it needs an African palate to conquer
the repulsiveness of this preparation.</p>

<p>Many types of vegetation, however, abound, to which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
are altogether unaccustomed, and can exhibit nothing which
appears to correspond. It is not only by the exuberance
and dignity of their forms that these are marked, but still
more by the novelty and grace with which Nature seems to
have invested them. No European production in any way
represents the <i lang="la">Anona senegalensis</i>, with its large blue-green
leaf and its small fruit. This fruit contains an aromatic
dark red pulp, and in a modest degree it displays something
of that captivating quality which has exalted its kindred
plant, the Cherimoyer of Peru, to its high repute as the
queen of fruits. It must be owned, however, that it is
difficult to secure a well-developed example of this fruit,
for so keenly is it spied out and devoured by the birds that
often for months together it may be sought in vain.</p>

<p>Much more singular is the magnificent candelabra-euphorbia,
which follows the pattern of its prototype, the
American cactus. Palms are not frequent enough to play
any important part in the scenery, or to demand any particular
specification. Groups of the Borassus are observed
near the river-banks, and the <i lang="la">Phœnix spinosa</i>, the original
of the date-palm, grows upon the marshes of the steppe.
Next must be mentioned the varieties of fig-trees, with
their leathery leaves, and, associated with them, those chief
characteristics of African vegetation, the Combreta and
the Rubiaceæ; tamarinds with their thick tubular corollas,
and shrubby Gardeniæ, dwarf and contorted. It was the
southern limit of the acacias of the White Nile; and only
in isolated cases was the stem of the Balanites to be seen,
lingering, as it were, on the steppes of Nubia. Even the
tamarind had become scarce, and farther south I did not
meet with it at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONFORMATION OF THE LAND.</div>

<p>In its general character the flora of this district seems
to conform very much to what has been discovered on the
table-land of Western Africa, of which the lower terraces
form a narrow belt along the shore, and are distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
for the wild luxuriance with which the African primeval
forest seeks to rival the splendour of Brazilian nature. In
contrast to this, the bush-forests in the higher parts of
Tropical Africa, broken by the steppes, present in uniformity
perhaps the most extensive district that could be pointed
out in the whole geography of vegetation. Extending,
as it does, from Senegal to the Zambesi, and from Abyssinia
to Benguela, Tropical Africa may be asserted to be
without any perceptible alternation in character, but that
which is offered by the double aspect of steppe and bush
on the one hand, and by primeval forest in the American
sense on the other. On the west this is illustrated by the
marked difference between the table-lands and the low coast-terraces,
whilst in the interior it is exhibited by the distinction
between the woods on the river banks and the flats
lying between the river courses. Here, in the country of
the Bongo and Dyoor, this, which may be designated as a
duality, almost completely fails, on account of the small
supply of water in the rivers and brooks; but in the land of
the Niam-niam it is again very striking.</p>

<p>Limited as have been the botanical collections of the few
who have explored this immense region, they are still sufficient
to justify us in estimating the relative abundance
of species. When the collections from Java and Brazil are
compared with those of Tropical Africa, it is certain that the
plants of Africa are not altogether half so numerous.</p>

<p>It is not in the least below the most abundant tropical
districts of the New World in producing timber trees. Trees
and shrubs constitute quite a fifth of the entire production,
and in the woods of the Bongo the variety of foliage is everywhere
astonishing. Any tracts covered by a single species
are altogether rare, and would exist only within the most
limited range. This uniformity of Tropical Africa in comparison
with the enormous space which it occupies, and the
striking want of provinces in the geography of its plants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
which it displays, are the results of several agencies. On the
one hand, it arises from the massive and compact form of the
whole; and on the other hand, by an external girdle which
keeps it shut up, so that it is not penetrated by foreign types
of vegetation. This girdle is made by currents of the sea
and long tracts of desert (the Sahara and Kalahari), and encircles
it entirely. In the direction towards Arabia there is,
as it were, a bridge into the regions of India, and, indeed, the
Indian flora has a great share in the characteristics of its
vegetation. The greater number of the African cultivated
plants, as well as nearly all their associated weeds, have been,
beyond a doubt, derived from India—&#8203;a conjecture, equivalent
to a prophecy, which Rob. Brown had formed at a time
when little was known of the vegetation of Central Africa.</p>

<p>Already have I expressed my happiness at having thus
reached the object of my cherished hopes—&#8203;my satisfaction
at thus finding life to be with me an idyll of African nature.
My health was unimpaired, and never before had I been less
hindered in prosecuting my pursuits. I felt alone in the
temple of creation. The people around me were somewhat
embarrassing. Their wickedness, with its attendant impurity,
stood out in sad contrast to the purity of nature; but it did
not much disturb the inner repose of this still life. In sickness
everything is sad, and the craving for home is not to be
suppressed; but whoever, in the robustness of health, can
imbibe the fresh animation of the wilderness, will find that
it stamps something of its unchanging verdure upon his
memory; his imagination will elevate it to a paradise, and
the days spent there will enrol themselves among the very
happiest of his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ABANDONED SERIBA.</div>

<p>One day in June there came back to the Seriba a company
which had been sent out by the agent to fetch the ivory
which had been stored in one of the minor Seribas of Ghattas
on the Rohl, 130 miles away to the south-west. The proper
place of embarkation for the Seribas on the Rohl, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
under a separate agent, is the Meshera Aboo-kooka, on the
Bahr-el-Gebel, which is nearer than the Gazelle; but during
this year the natives were animated by such a hostile spirit,
that the shorter route was impracticable, and thus it was
necessary to proceed to the banks of the Gazelle. In April
the chief Seriba in this territory had been abandoned by the
few men who had been left, after nearly all their entire
garrison of a hundred men had been killed during a raid
against the Dinka tribe of the Agar. The remnant, who had
been informed of the calamity by some friendly natives, found
themselves in a great strait. They could see no prospect
of defending themselves, and were compelled to surrender
all their stores and ammunition, and to escape under
cover of night to one of the dependent Seribas. The main
body of the troops were still out on an expedition to the
Niam-niam country, and it was only the fear of their sudden
return which deterred the Agar from annihilating the very
last of their foes. They plundered and burnt down the
Seriba, which has never since been restored. It was formerly
the property of the brothers Poncet, although they were
never known to visit it. Petherick halted at it whilst he
was on his desperate march to Gondokoro, and inserted it
upon his map under the name of Adael. Bad tidings travel
quickly, and so it chanced that the intelligence of this disaster
reached Khartoom before my letters; the details were
related very indistinctly, and my friends were for a while
under some apprehension about my fate.</p>

<p>In another respect a star of ill-luck seemed this year to
have risen over the enterprise of the company of Ghattas.
The season had drawn near in which the agents usually
commenced their annual depredations in the districts of the
Dinka to replenish their stock of cattle. As the various
associations were entering upon mutual competition, in order
to prevent disagreements, there was laid down a kind of
Seriba law, which was pretty well the same everywhere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
First of all, the territories immediately dependent were distinctly
designated. Then it provided that the approaches
to a meshera should only be used by those who could establish
a claim to it. Nearly every Seriba has its separate
avenues, upon which it levies a toll, and an avenue without
tolls is not a legitimate highway at all. If any extraordinary
companies desire to make use of these roads, they must first
come to terms with the Seriba agents, who have the supervision
of the right of way. Even chieftains who supply provisions
to those who are on their transit, would be sure to
attack them as foes if they were not first conciliated by being
appointed as guides and dragomen.</p>

<p>Very similar was the arrangement that regulated all the
expeditions which were undertaken against the Niam-niam.
Each separate company had its own route and its own train
of captains, who purchased the ivory and procured a market.
No new-comers were allowed to intrude themselves into an
established market, or to infringe upon its trade. Fresh
marts could only be established by pressing farther onwards
into the interior. These new establishments in their turn
were subject to monopoly, and were rigidly protected. Whereever
any violation of this rule occurred, there would be very
serious conflicts—&#8203;so much so, that amongst the Nubians the
affray was very often fatal. This, however, would only
happen while the contest was limited between one negro and
another, for true Nubians at once renounce all allegiance to
a leader who presumed to shoot a brother Nubian.</p>

<p>The Khartoom companies are most jealous of all their
rights of cattle-plunder, alike in this region and in every
other. The district over which the incursions of Ghattas
ranged embraced the whole of the lower course of the river
Tondy. During the previous year it was said that the total
of the booty was no less than 800 oxen; but this year,
although the aggressions were thrice renewed, the result was
altogether a failure, and was quite a derision amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
neighbours, being barely forty head of cattle. In vain had
they explored the country west of the Tondy; to no purpose
had they scoured the territories alike of the Rek and of the
Lao; everywhere they were just too late. The Dinka had
got intelligence betimes, and off they packed their herds
and families to the inaccessible marshes. Their mere superiority
in numbers here gave them the advantage, and they
could hold their own against considerable troops of armed
marauders. The whole Dinka tribe amongst them could
hardly boast a single musket which could go off properly.
Other companies, which had been more fortunate in plunder,
were now ready to avail themselves of the opportunity to
dispose of their superfluous cattle in barter for what the
country afforded. Sometimes it might be for slaves, or for
copper-rings, or sometimes (and this was a very favourite
method) for bills of exchange upon Khartoom. Thus those
who lived upon robbery were glad mutually to make a
market of each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CATTLE-RAIDS ON THE DINKA.</div>

<p>The mode of carrying out these raids may be thus exemplified:
On the last occasion 140 armed troops, accompanied
by a recognised train of some hundred natives, followed
again by a lot of people with a keen scent for cattle of any
sort, had set out upon their enterprise. In this cavalcade they
had proceeded exactly as though their intention was merely
to reach some Seriba or other. Then, all of a sudden, when
they saw that the chances were in their favour, just at nightfall
(deviating to one side, or even retracing their steps),
they marched on till, generally at break of day, they arrived
at the devoted murah. Having surrounded it, they began
to beat their gongs and to fire away vigorously. They were
so alarmed at the likelihood of hitting each other in the legs
(for that is the general result of their firing) that they merely
discharged a lot of blank cartridges into the air. This, however,
was quite sufficient to intimidate the natives, who lost
no time in making their escape through the gaps which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
invading party were careful to provide in their ranks. In a
general way the Dinka have no larger number of servants
with them at their cattle-farms than is absolutely necessary,
and, as I have mentioned, they leave their wives and children
in outlying huts, so that these are very rarely exposed to the
rapine of the invaders.</p>

<p>By the help of the negroes which they bring with them,
the invaders soon make themselves masters of all the herds,
and hurry back covered by the protection of the soldiers.
To supply the requirements of a year it is necessary that
they should secure by their raid at least 2000 head of oxen.
Of the plundered property two-thirds belong to the authorities,
the remaining third being assigned to the soldiers, who
hawk it about and dispose of it as they please. A portion,
however, is first allotted to the leaders of the negroes, to the
overseers of the districts, and to the chiefs, which is ever
an excuse for great rejoicing. The scandalous accomplices,
abettors, and receivers of this odious commerce are those
professed slave-traders, the Gellahba, who have succeeded in
finding snug quarters for themselves in every Seriba, where
they manage, like idle drones, to enjoy the produce of the
toil of the industrious. Their transactions extend to calicoes,
soaps, and head-gear; they deal in firelocks, looking-glasses,
and onions; they can sell a few slaves, old or young, male or
female; they find a market for rings and beads; they do
something in amulets and verses of the Koran; very often
they have on hand some bullocks, sheep, or goats; indeed
there is hardly anything which chance does not occasionally
throw into their line of business. Thus it came to pass that
this year they carried on a thriving cattle-trade in our settlement.
From the other marauding companies, whose luck
had been better, they had acquired a considerable store of
cattle, and they did not miss the opportunity of turning it
now to their own advantage.</p>

<p>When I consider the ravages that are made year after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
year on so large a scale upon the cattle of the Dinka, and
the enormous consumption of the Nubians, I confess that it
is quite an enigma to me how the supply is not exhausted.
Although I am aware that they never kill their cattle, yet
the murrain of flies every season decimates their herds; and,
besides this, their cows very seldom ever calve more than
once, and very frequently remain utterly barren. Observations
of this kind somewhat assist us in forming an estimate
of the vast numbers of the people, since for the mere oversight
and custody of the myriads of cattle there must be multitudes
of men corresponding to the hand-to-mouth population of our
civilised communities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO SUBSIDIARY SERIBAS.</div>

<p>From the 21st of July until the 4th of August I made a
tour, which gave me an opportunity of inspecting the subsidiary
Seribas of Ghattas. My acquaintance with the
country was thus materially enlarged. A march of about
four leagues towards the south-west brought me again, by a
road which I had not hitherto traversed, to Geer, where the
fields of sesame were already in bloom. The sesame in this
district all had white blossoms, while in the Nile country it as
uniformly blooms with a pale rose-coloured flower, and this is
by no means an uncommon feature in the flora of the region.
I could exhibit a long list of plants which elsewhere are
either red or blue, but here are invariably white; but I could
not offer any satisfactory explanation of the circumstance.</p>

<p>Like all my other wanderings in the interior, this little
excursion was made entirely on foot. To get along through
the tall grass was anything but easy. The negroes tread
down a sort of gutter, the width of their foot, and along these
we made our way, as in a wheel-rut, as best we could. It
was quite necessary to keep one’s steps verging inwards. Occasionally
these gutters change their character and become
water-courses, by means of which the adjacent steppes are
drained. But the enjoyment of a luxuriant nature, with its
perpetual change of scene, and the charms of novelty which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
presented themselves in the foliage, compensated richly for a
little toil; and day by day practice made the trouble lighter.</p>

<p>This tour contributed in various ways to my stock of information.
In Geer I met with the clerk from the Seriba
destroyed by the Agar, who related to me the adventures
which the sufferers had endured upon their flight. With a
Faki from Darfoor, who had formerly visited Bornu and the
Western Soudan, I had a long geographical dispute as to
whether the great river of the Monbuttoo emptied itself
into the Tsad, or flowed direct into the sea. The foreigner
argued justly for the Shary, whilst I, on the other hand, was
referring to the Benwe. I succeeded in stirring him and all
the other interested listeners to a state of considerable amazement
at my acquaintance with localities of which they had
no knowledge except by report and which they hardly knew
even by name. I told them about the whole series of states
right away from Darfoor to the ocean. For about the
hundredth time I had again to answer the inquiry why
Europeans want so much ivory. The curiosity on their part
is quite intelligible, as ivory is the unseen incentive which
keeps alive the system of plunder practised by the Nubians,
and I endeavoured to make them comprehend something
about the handles of knives and sticks and parasols, the
pianoforte keys, the billiard-balls, and the variety of other
uses to which the material is applied.</p>

<p>From Geer, with its questions of geography, history, and
political economy, I proceeded another league and a half,
and came to Addai, where the whole armed force was
employing itself most peaceably in the art of tailoring. In
nearly all Mohammedan countries needlework is the business
of the men. A short league brought me to Koolongo, past
which there flows a copious stream, bordered by thick jungles
01 impenetrable bamboos, and which, not far from Addai,
flows into the Tondy. The stream is singularly abundant in
fish, and the Bongo were busy in securing their chief haul.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
They proceed very much in the European way of damming
up the stream by weirs, and laying down wicker-pots of considerable
size. The fishing, for the most part, is done twice in
the year; first, at the commencement of the rainy season, and
again when the waters begin to subside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KILNOKY AND GURR.</div>

<p>A large proportion of the fish captured in this stream is
nearly the same as what is found in the Lower Nile and in
Egypt; but some sorts are found which are peculiar;
amongst which the fish-salamander (<i lang="la">Lepidosiren</i>) and some
Siluridæ may be mentioned as representatives of the tropics
in Africa. There is one kind of these called Kilnoky by
the Bongo, and which is rather interesting. It reminds one
of the species of the Auchenipterus or Synodontis, which are
distinguished by their forked tail-fins. Another of the most
frequent fish is that known as the “Besher” of the Nile, here
called “Gurr” by the natives.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The elegant, large-scaled
<i lang="la">Heterotis niloticus</i>, which the Bongo style the “Goggoh,”
has a tender flesh and is of a good flavour. The river does
not generally abound with fish which are desirable for food,
but those which can be eaten generally belong to the section
of the Characini; for example, the <i lang="la">Hydrocyon Forskalii</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
which is here called “Kyalo.” This is a grey-streaked fish,
glittering like pearl, in shape not unlike a salmon; it has
red fins and a regular dog’s head, of which the lanky jaws,
armed with conical teeth, amply justify the systematic
name. Related to this is the “Raha” (<i lang="la">Ichtyborus microlepis</i>),
which is noteworthy for its pike’s head, and the small-scaled
<i lang="la">Distichodus rostratus</i>, or “Heeloo,” as it is termed. There is
another sort which the Bongo call “Tonga.” Besides these
there are the “Kalo” (<i lang="la">Alestis</i>) and the “Dologoh” (<i lang="la">Citharinus</i>).
Of the perch, which plays so prominent a part in
these waters, the silver-grey <i lang="la">Lates niloticus</i>, known as “Golo,”
is very abundant, and perhaps still more so the “Warr”
(<i lang="la">Chromis</i>), about the length of a finger, and of which there
are several descriptions. The “Warr,” when first caught, is
of a dark-green tint crossed obliquely by a number of broad
dark stripes. The most common, however, of all the fish, and
which seems never to fail in any of the marshes left by the
retreating floods, are the sheath-fish, which belong to the
Clarias species, the white flesh of which has a detestable
flavour of the swamps; and the “Geegongoh,” which while
they are alive are so like in colour to the brown slime in
which they roll that they cannot be distinguished from it.
A rare sort of the smaller fish is that known as the
“Banghey,” and which belongs to the species of the Schilbe.
Interesting, as being a representative in Africa of an Indian
species, is the speckled grey and brown <i lang="la">Ophiocephalus
obscurus</i>. It only remains to mention among the lesser sorts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
“Ndeer” (<i lang="la">Ctenopoma Petherickii</i>), the “Labyrinthi” of the
Marango (<i lang="la">Labeo Forskalii</i>), and the “Möll” (<i lang="la">Mormyrus
cyprinoides</i>).</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>There are two methods which the Bongo employ to preserve
the flesh of their fish. Table salt they cannot get, but
they substitute what they obtain from ashes. They cut the
fish through lengthways, simply expose it to be dried in the
sun, and afterwards hang it up to be fumigated in the clouds
of smoke which fill their huts. Another way is to cut the
fish up and dry it, and then to pound it all up in mortars
until it is reduced to a jelly, which is rolled into balls about
the size of the fist. These, with their high flavour, form
a favourite ingredient in soups and sauces, which are entirely
wanting in all other aromatic condiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAUNTED CAVE AT KOOLONGO.</div>

<p>In Kulongo so many ridiculous tales were dressed up for
me about the wonders of the subterranean world, and of the
abodes of evil spirits in the neighbouring caves, that I glowed
with the desire to make their acquaintance. No one that
I could find in the Seriba had ever ventured to visit the
dreaded grottoes, and the alarm of the Governor was a great
joke; after he had talked away for an hour, and declared
he would accompany me, he ended by offering a handsome
“backsheesh” to one of his subordinates to take his place;
but his offer to go had been publicly made, and, as matter of
honour, he was bound to attend me. We had to cross a
stream ten feet in depth, and as, on account of an injury to
his foot, he was riding an ass, the timid fellow found just the
pretext he wanted to excuse his return; he could not allow
his invaluable donkey to get a chill. In a party of eight,
including myself, we set out towards the house of terror:
three of my own servants, two of the <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> soldiers, and
two of the natives who acted as guides. This company
however, could not help considering themselves inadequate
to face the peril, and as we approached the caves some extra
negroes from the adjacent fields were pressed into the
service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Uphill for a while was our way from Kulongo, and on
accomplishing the ascent we had before us a wide plain, and
about a league away we could discern the spot, shrouded in
a thick coppice, which was the object of our march. Reaching
the entrance to the cavern, we found it blocked up through a
considerable fall of earth, which apparently had been caused
by the washing away of the surface soil by springs bubbling
up from beneath; and the outside was so choked up by
masses of underwood, that no one could suspect that there
was a grotto in the rear.</p>

<p>When, fourteen or fifteen years previously, the first intruders
made their way into this district, the story goes that
hundreds of the natives, with their wives and children and
all their goods and chattels, betook themselves to this inaccessible
retreat; and that having died of starvation, their
evil spirits survive and render their place of refuge a place
of danger. Just as we had contrived to push a little way
into the thicket, an idea struck one of my servants that he
could be as cunning as his master. Finding that I persevered
in my intention, he bethought himself of the bees on the
White Nile, and so there rose the shout of “Bees, bees!”
from more than one of the party. But they got some stings
they hardly looked for: one good box on the ear, followed up
by another and another, made their cheeks tingle again, and
they were fain to proceed. I can still laugh as I picture to
myself those nigger rascals resigning themselves to enter
the shrubs, and I see them heaving a sigh, and looking as if
they were ready to send their lances through the first devil
they should happen to meet. I followed them on through
the hazardous pathway, the darkness growing ever deeper.
Stumbling on, we made our way over blocks of stone, descending
for more than a hundred feet till we reached the
entrance of the cave, which, after a low kind of porchway
through the rifled rocks, arches itself into a spacious grotto,
capable of sheltering some thousand men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INVOKING THE SPIRITS.</div>

<p>In place of any heart-rending shrieks of wicked ghosts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
there was nothing more to alarm us than the whizzing of
countless bats (<i lang="la">Phyllorhina caffra</i>), and thus at once the
whole veil of romance was torn asunder. We reclined for a
time in the cool shade, and then I invited the whole party to
take part in a scene of conjuration, for which they were quite
prepared. With the full strength of my voice I cried,
“Samiel, Samiel, Afreed!” invoking the spirits of evil to put
in an appearance; thus all pretext of fear from that quarter
was put to rest; and now belief in ghosts took another shape,
and the men pretended that they were terrified, because the
cave was a lurking-place of lions; but as a fine brown dust
covered the floor of the grotto, leaving it as smooth as
though it had just been raked over, I asked them to show
me some traces of the lions. They could detect nothing,
however, but the vestiges of some porcupines, of which a few
quills made it clear that other creatures besides ghosts and bats
made the cave their home. That brown dust was a vast mass of
guano that had gradually accumulated; I brought away a sack
of it with me, and it worked wonders in making my garden
productive, resulting in some cabbages of giant growth.</p>

<p>The rocky walls of the cave, dripping as they were with
moisture, were covered with thick clusters of moss, which
took the most variegated forms, and were quite a surprise in
this region of Central Africa, where mosses are very scarce.
A regular network of foliage, with long creepers and thorny
brambles, filled up the entire glen upon which the grotto
opened, so that no ray of sunlight could ever penetrate.</p>

<p>The Bongo give the name of “Gubbehee” (or the subterranean)
to this cavern. I tried to creep into some of the
crevices, but was soon obliged to desist, sometimes because
the fissures were too narrow, and sometimes because the multitudes
of bats came flying out in my face, and sometimes
because the reeking ammonia choked me, and made further
progress impossible. By some shots, however, which I discharged,
I convinced myself of the magnitude of these rifts,
which, within a few inches, were full of guano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>Full of spirits, we retraced our steps to the Seriba, and
had some sport with the Governor about his pretence of the
susceptibility of his donkey. When I asked him to accept a
bet of 100 dollars that he would pass a night by himself in the
cave, he was quite as bumptious as on the day before; but I
moderated his enthusiasm by suggesting that his donkey, perhaps,
was worth more than the 100 dollars, and that I was sure
that the donkey could not stand the damp. The result was,
that he declined the engagement, and cried off the wager.</p>

<p>These details will answer the purpose of showing what
kind of heroes these cattle-stealers and men-hunters are. To
them most literally applies Dante’s verse, when he speaks of
the saucy herds who, “behind the fugitives swell with rage,
but let these show their teeth, or even stretch out their
purse, and at once they are gentle as a lamb.” Against the
poor faint-hearted negroes they were valiant and full of
pluck; but all their courage vanished into nothing when they
came in contact with the Shillooks and Bari.</p>

<p>In Kulongo were wide plains covered with earth-nuts,
which attract multitudes of the jackals of the country, which
scratch up the nuts, and crack them with their teeth. The
jackal (the “bashohm” of the Nubians, <i lang="la">Canis variegatus</i>)
is one of the most common animals in Bongo-land. It is
about the size of an ordinary fox, in colour being like a wolf,
with black back and tail. They are pretty sure to be seen
in the early morning, squatting comfortably down, and composedly
enjoying the nuts. I knocked over several of them
with heavy shot, and took care of their skins, which gave me
some beautiful fur. The bashohm is very destructive among
the poultry of the villages, doing even more mischief than the
wild cat, which does not care to venture so near the huts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANOTHER DESERTED SERIBA.</div>

<p>From Kulongo I returned to Geer, from which it is distant
about as far as from Addai. Half a league on the way
we came to a spot where a deserted Seriba of Ghattas’s
exhibited its desolate remains. The sight here was very
striking; after penetrating the tall masses of grass, we found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
some self-sown sorghum, the stalks of which reached the
astonishing length of 20 feet, being beyond question the
tallest cereal in the world. The extraordinary growth was
probably to be attributed to the manuring substances
which, year after year, collect upon and fertilise the soil.
The palisades of the old Seriba were still partially standing,
and were hardly higher than the surrounding grass, and
the ruins were overgrown with wild gourds, calabashes, and
cucumbers. The bare frameworks of the conical roofs had
fallen to the ground, and lay like huge crinolines: they
served as supports to the growing pumpkins, and formed in
this condition a thick shady bower.</p>

<p>The extensive wilderness derived a weird aspect from the
strange stillness that pervaded the deserted dwellings. There
was not a song from a bird, there was hardly the humming
of an insect; it seemed as if Nature were revelling in her
undisputed sway, or as if the curse of a prophet had been
wreaked upon the abodes of violence and of plunder.</p>

<p>By the end of July all the bamboos were in full blossom.
The grains are not unlike rye, and are edible, and, in times
of dearth, have been known to form a substitute for the
exhausted corn. When the fruit is mature, the long, ramified
panicles have a very remarkable appearance, and the
ears, clustered together at their base, radiate like an ancient
whirlbat. Very rarely, however, does the African bamboo
bloom, so that it is not often that it supplies the place of
ordinary corn.</p>

<p>At an equal distance of about a league and a half from
Kulongo and from Geer lies the village of Gurfala. The
way thither led through perpetual marshes and was so
interrupted by deep masses of mud that I had repeatedly to
change my clothes. When the naked skin is exposed to the
filth of the bogs, it is not only annoyed by a number of
insects, some of them harmless enough, many of them most
disgusting, but it is terribly cut by the sharp edges of the
grass. This not merely causes considerable pain, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
wounds inflicted in this way are often very troublesome
and slow to heal; they not unfrequently result among the
Nubians in serious sores, and have been known to entail
the loss of a foot. At every Seriba there will be found
some who are suffering from this cause, and Baker observed
the recurrence of the same evil amongst his people.
As the same consequences do not occur in Nubia itself they
are probably to be attributed to the effect of the climate.
The backs of the negroes are not available for transport
over any long distances of this fenny land, because of the
insecurity of the footing; and in another respect this mode
of conveyance offers little attraction; to mount one of the
negroes is almost as disastrous to one’s white summer
garments as an actual tumble into the marsh. Soap is not
a common article hereabout, and must be used economically,
and the traveller has to put up with a general wash about
once in two months.</p>

<p>All the minor Seribas are really established for the purpose
of overlooking the Bongo, and the sub-agents are always in
trepidation lest there should be a sudden disappearance of all
their negroes. It has not unfrequently happened that whole
communities of the Bongo, quite unawares, have taken up
their baggage, started off from their state of subjection, and,
escaping the hands of their masters, have established themselves
amongst the neighbouring Dinka. If they wish to
cultivate corn for themselves, who could venture to blame
them?</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFRICAN DISTILLERY.</div>

<p>The Bongo name for Gurfala is Ngulfala, which indicates
an earlier tribe of this race, which is no longer separated into
various clans. Gurfala, I found, had its amusing associations.
As in Kulongo it was the fear of ghosts for which the people
had been conspicuous, so here it was the effect of a great
brandy-distillery upon the inhabitants that entertained me.
This distillery was kept by an old Egyptian, one of the few
of his race who resided in the district of the Seribas. Out of
an “ardeb,” or about five bushels of sorghum, he managed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
with his rude apparatus, to extract about thirty bottles of
watery alcohol. The sallow old Egyptian, whom the enjoyment
of his vile liquors had tanned till his skin was as dry as
parchment, was, as it were, director of a joint-stock company,
of which the sub-agents and the soldiers in the Seriba were
the shareholders, contributing their quota of corn to the
concern. The apparatus for distilling consisted of a series
of covered clay retorts, connected by tubes made of bamboo;
the establishment for working was made up of a party of
fat-bellied, swarthy women slaves, who had to pound away
at the grain in a mortar; and as often as they paused for
a moment to recover their breath, after their grinding
exertions, they invariably panted till they reminded one of
exhausted Cybeles. The chief material used was sorghum;
the produce was a vile spirit. All the Nubians who settle
here would abandon themselves very much to the use of
brandy, if it could be more readily procured and if a continual
superabundance were at their disposal; their fanaticism,
however, is irreproachable; they rigorously follow the
prescription of their law, and most scrupulously observe
the Fast of Ramadan.</p>

<p>Together with the fresh relays arrived rows of spirit-flasks
in their original packing (mostly made at Breslau), which are
stored away in the magazines. These find their way from
Alexandria and Khartoom to this remote corner of traffic. The
agents drink their spirits neat, and cannot get it strong
enough to please them; everybody else dilutes it with two-thirds
water or mixes it with his merissa. In their drinking-bouts
they used to besiege me with applications for some of
the sharp radishes from my garden, which on these occasions
they seemed especially to relish. What was most revolting to
me about their intoxication was that they always preferred
the early hours of the morning for their indulgence, and for
the rest of the day became incapable of standing upright.
After they were tipsy they were just as pugnacious as
Europeans, but the excitability of the South would break out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
so that manslaughter and death were not of unfrequent
occurrence.</p>

<p>After a couple of days I took my departure from the huts
of Gurfala, where a number of the Gellahba also have settled
themselves, and I made my way over a short two leagues
towards the west to Doomookoo, the fifth of the Ghattas
Seribas. The route was over a firm soil, alternately bushwood
and open steppe. The grass on the rocky level seemed
to have a permanent character. All of one kind, and covering
large tracts of country, it reminded me of the waving ears of
our own cornfields. Although the region seems to be destitute
of any continuance of trees, it far surpasses the European
plains and meadow lands in the variety of its permanent
grasses.</p>

<p>About half-way there was a pond made by rain on the
rocky ground, which was covered with the large red-headed
geese of the Gambia and a number of widow-buntings. Only
during the rainy season do these birds quit the waters of
the great Nile and find their way to the interior.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUNDO.</div>

<p>At Doomookoo I found the negroes all astir; an equipment
was being made for an expedition to Gebel Higgoo,
and, with the co-operation of Aboo Guroon, was to consist of a
hundred armed men. Mukhtar, the captain of the troop, repeatedly
assured me that he could reach his destination in about
five days, and I was much disposed to accompany him. But
there was in my way this obstacle, that I was obliged to get
my correspondence off-hand; I had to write my letters for a
whole year. The mountains Higgoo and Shetatah have been
so denominated for some cause by the Nubians; Higgoo
signifying a bandbox, and Shetatah being their name for
cayenne pepper. They lie in a southerly direction from
where we were, only a few leagues distant from that Mundo
which is so often mentioned by Petherick; a spot which on
every map is notoriously always pushed either backwards or
forwards for several degrees, and originally, by those who
professed to have visited it, was said to be situated on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Equator. The fact is, that Mundo is the name ordinarily
given by the Bongo to a small tribe calling itself Babuckur,
which has contrived to wedge in its position between the
borders of the Bongo and the Niam-niam. On the eastern
limit the Bongo denote the Niam-niam themselves by this
name of Mundo. To the isolated hills of this border-land,
such of the Bongo as could maintain their independence
made good their retreat, and only in consequence of the
contemplated expedition of the Khartoomers were they laid
under tribute. During the present year the trading companies
had established a number of settlements here amongst
them, these advanced colonies being necessary for the security
of the highways for traffic into the Niam-niam territory.
Hitherto all the avenues for transit had been found liable to
attack from the uncontrolled Bongo and from the Babuckur;
but now the entire region was sequestered, and made a kind
of preserve, on which the two companies could meet and
monopolise their slave-plunder.</p>

<p>In one of the more extended low-lying steppes, overgrown
with its mass of vegetation, I lost a whole day in vain
endeavours to secure an antelope of that large breed which
is found here, but which seems to elude all pursuit, in the
course of the chase learning to discriminate a considerable
number of species. Fate was here unpropitious. Manœuvre
as I would, I could not sneak up close enough to get a shot.
More than once I saw large herds of Leucotis, grazing apparently
in entire repose; but every movement of mine was so
dependent upon the formation of the ground, and every disturbance
of the tall grass resulted in such a crackling, that
to meditate a surprise was out of the question. If ever I
flattered myself that I was gaining some advantage, and was
getting close to the herd under cover of a detached bush, I
was sure to be betrayed by the keen vision and disquietude
of some stray beast that was hanging on the flank. Still
greater were the obstacles that occurred if pursuit were tried
in the drier tracts by the border of the lowlands. Here were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
seen whole troops of the Aboo Maaref (<i lang="la">A. nigra</i>), like great
goats, with their sharp horns and their flowing manes, proudly
strutting on the plain; but, times without number, on the
first alarm they bounded off. No avail that their black
wrinkled horns were right before us, rising and sinking in
the grass, offering a mark indeed somewhat indefinite; no
good that we crept on, three at a time, one taking the wilderness,
another the thicket, and the third, step by step,
getting through the marshy hollows—&#8203;everything was ineffectual:
just as we thought we were getting an advantage,
either some one would fall into a hole, or would shake a
bough that hung over his head, or would disturb the crackling
stalks in the bushes, and all hope was gone; the signal
of danger was circulated, and the herd were out of reach.
These details will furnish an idea of the endless artifices by
means of which the chase in the rainy seasons has to be practised
to insure success. Wet through, and with clothes saturated
with the mire of the marshes, extremely weary, and
having only succeeded in sending one poor Aboo Maaref
hopping on three legs after its companions, we returned at
the close of our day of unsuccessful exploit.</p>

<p>The return to my headquarters from Doomookoo was a
journey of about four and a half leagues. I found the way
entertaining enough. Elevated dry flats of rocks came in
turns with inundated lowlands; and after passing through
pleasant woodlands the road would wind through open
steppes. Game was everywhere most abundant. It was
only necessary to withdraw for an hour from a settlement
to get an impression that the whole of the animal creation
had ceased to give itself any concern about the proceedings
of man. Not one of the soldiers, whose lives are lavished
by their employers in a hundred useless ways, finds the
least enjoyment in the noble pleasures of the chase.
They all shirk the trouble, and, even if they could get
up the necessary perseverance, they are such bad shots
that they could hardly recompense themselves for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
exertion. Besides this they prefer the very rankest of
their goats’ flesh to the choicest venison; partly it may be
from the general uniformity of their diet, or partly perhaps
from their religious aversion to eat of meat slaughtered in
a manner that is not prescribed in their law; certainly it is
very rare for them, in their wanderings, to partake of any
game which they have captured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HEGOLEH AND THE DELOO.</div>

<p>There are two little antelopes which are here very common,
and which roam about the country in pairs. One of these
is the Hegoleh (<i lang="la">A. madoqua</i>) which appears to be found
right through from Abyssinia to the Gambia; the other is
the Deloo (<i lang="la">A. grimmia</i>), which is known also in the south.
They are both pretty and lively bright-eyed creatures, of
which the entire length is but little over three feet; they
correspond very nearly to a small roe, or the fawn of a fallow
deer.</p>

<p>The Hegoleh is all of one colour—&#8203;a light tawny with a
greyish throat, not so foxy as the Leucotis. The Deloo is
of a fawn colour on its back, with a tinge of yellow in front;
its flanks are nearly white, whilst its ankles are black. Its
head is very expressive; a black stripe runs along it and
terminates in a dark brown tuft; this gives to the female,
which has no horns, rather a comical look, running up as it
does into a stiff peak of about five inches long: in the males
this growth is concealed by the short horns. Both kinds are
distinguished by the glands of the lacrymal ducts.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The
Madoqua has two pair of these, one pair set under the roots
of the ear, making a triangle of an area of half a square inch;
the other pair in the tear-pits composing a sort of pouch,
about an inch long, which consists of a deep fold of skin, and
from which is discharged a viscous and colourless matter.
Above the tear-glands, towards the nasal bone, there projects
on each side from the frontlet a thick pad about three inches
long, which seems to have an adenoid texture, almost like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
a tumour. In the same way as with the Cervicapra, these
tear-glands during any excitement open themselves like the
nostrils of a snorting horse. The Deloo has only one pair of
these glands, which lie horizontally in a narrow streak across
the hollow of the eyes. Both kinds are alike in never venturing
into the low grounds exposed to floods, and in preferring
the rocky lands which are covered with bushwood.
They often get into the middle of a thicket, and startle the
huntsman by suddenly springing out, in the same way as
the Ben-Israel or Om-digdig of Abyssinia (<i lang="la">A. Hemprichiana</i>).
The flesh of both these antelopes is very indifferent for
eating as compared with the larger kinds; that of the Deloo
when roasted having a singular acrid flavour, which seems to
suggest the unpleasantness of the glands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CULTIVATION OF SORGHUM.</div>

<p>Towards the end of August the sorghum-harvest commenced
with the pulling of the light crop of the four-monthly
sort, which had been sown in the latter part of April. But
the general ingathering of the heavier varieties, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
contribute chiefly to the supply of corn, did not take place
until the beginning of December, after the rainy season was
over. In Sennaar and Taka, sorghum requires five or six
months to come to maturity, but in this district it rarely
takes less than eight months. Both the early and late sorts
commonly attain a height of nearly fifteen feet; the stalks
of the former remain quite green, but the reedy stems of the
latter become so strong and woody, that they are used for
fences to divide one enclosure from another. Some of the
varieties are scarcely inferior to the regular sugar millet
(<i lang="la">Sorghum saccharatum</i>) in producing an abundance of saccharine
matter; these are known to the negroes as well as
to the Arabians of the Soudan, who chew the straw and so
express the juice. The Bongo and the Dyoor express the
pulp by means of wooden mortars, and boil it till it has the
consistency of syrup. From this concoction I was able to
procure a spirit which was far more palatable than what I
should have obtained by distilling the sorghum itself.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Both varieties of the common sorghum,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
abound in all their minor differences of colour, shape, and
size of grain, yield well-nigh a dozen different descriptions
for the market at Khartoom. The standard value is fixed
by the Fatareetah, a pure white thin-skinned grain, which
also is grown by the negroes in the Seriba.</p>

<p>All negro races that depend upon agriculture for their
subsistence consider the cultivation of sorghum most important.
Of the people among which I travelled, the Bongo,
the Dyoor, and the Mittoo, were examples of this. On the
other hand, among the southern Niam-niam and the Monbuttoo
this cereal is quite unknown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIMITATION OF GRAIN PRODUCE.</div>

<p>I could not help being astonished at the length of time
which most of the kinds take to ripen. In some fields a
portion of the stubble is left intentionally ungrubbed until
the next season; this will die down, but, after the first rain,
it sprouts again from the root, and so a second gathering is
made from the same stem. No loosening of the soil is ever
made, and this perhaps accounts in a degree for the tardiness
of the growth. With the small spades, of which I have
already spoken, shallow holes are sunk in the ground at
intervals of about a yard: into these is dropped the corn,
which then is trodden down by the foot. It is only during
the first few months that any labour at all is given to the
fields, just to remove from the surface of the soil the multitudes
of weeds which will spring up. These weeds are
gathered into heaps, and form the only manure which is employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
in this lavish laboratory of nature. Never more than
once is this weeding repeated; it is done by the women and
children; and the corn is then left entirely to take its chance
until it is time to gather it. On account alike of its tall
growth and of its luxuriant habit, the men are careful not
to plant it too thickly. The country does not offer many
materials for manuring the land; if, therefore, greater application
of labour or of skill should succeed in doubling the
yield of every stem, there would ultimately be no gain.
The soil, which already in many places fails after the second
year, would only be exhausted so much the sooner. Such
being the case, every project of ameliorating the condition of
this people by enlarging their crop is quite an illusion; the
land could not sustain a larger number than that which
already resides upon it.</p>

<p>In my garden I made several attempts to sow wheat, but
without much success. Probably I should have prospered
better if I could have obtained some European seed: mine
was from Khartoom, and it is very likely that the conditions
under which it had been grown, amidst the flooded fields of
the Nile Valley, on a soil far more soddened than that of this
district, had been very injurious to the grain.</p>

<p>Very unwisely, not one of the Seriba governors has ever
made an attempt to introduce into the district the culture of
rice, for which the low marshy fields, otherwise useless, seem,
very admirably adapted; but the people are not to be taught;
vain the endeavour to initiate them even into a rational
system of burning charcoal; and as to the culture of rice,
nothing throughout the whole of Nubia was known about it.
On the contrary, the expeditions which have set out from
Zanzibar, and which have explored districts where the climate
is not dissimilar to that of which we speak, have introduced
the cultivation of rice over a very considerable area.
The finger of nature itself seems to point out the propriety of
not neglecting this product; in the whole district south
of the Gazelle the wild rice of Senegal grows quite freely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
and this I always found of a better quality than the best
kinds of Damietta. During the rains the wild rice (<i lang="la">Oryza
punctata</i>) environs many a pool with its garland of reddish
ears, and seems to thrive exceedingly, but it never occurs to
the sluggish natives to gather the produce that is lost in the
water; and it is only because the Baggara and some of
the inhabitants of Darfoor had saved some quantity, that I
contrived to get my small supply.</p>

<p>There yet remain three kinds of corn to which a passing
reference should be made in order to complete a general
survey of the agriculture of this district.</p>

<p>Next to the sorghum stands the penicillaria, or Arabian
“dokhn,” to which much attention is devoted, and which is
cultivated here much more freely than in the northern
Soudan. Sown somewhat later than the sorghum, somewhat
later it comes to maturity.</p>

<p>A second substitute on the land for sorghum is a meagre
grain, the <i lang="la">Eleusine coracana</i>. By the Arabians it is called
telaboon, and by the Abyssinians tocusso; it is only grown
on the poorest soils and where the ground is too wet
to admit of any better crop. The grain of this is very
small and generally black, and is protected by a hard
thick skin; it has a disagreeable taste, and makes only a
wretched sort of pap. It yields a yeast that is more fit for
brewing than for baking; in fact, not only do the Niam-niam,
who are the principal growers of the Eleusine, but
the Abyssinians as well, make a regular beer by means
of it.</p>

<p>Midway between the sorghum and the penicillaria must
be reckoned the maize of the country, which only grows in
moderate quantity, and is here generally cultivated as a
garden vegetable in the immediate proximity of the huts.
The Madi tribe of the Mittoo are the only people who seem
to cultivate it to any great extent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFRICAN WHEATS.</div>

<p>There is one quality which pertains equally to all these
varieties of grain which are grown in these torrid regions; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
is not possible from the flour which they provide to make
bread in the way to which we are accustomed. All that can
be made from the fermented dough is the Arabian bread,
“kissere,” as it is called—&#8203;tough, leathery slices, cooked like
pancakes on a frying-pan. If the fermentation has gone on
far enough to make the dough rise for a good spongy loaf,
when it is put into the oven it all crumples up, and its particles
will not hold together; if, on the other hand, the fermentation
has not proceeded sufficiently, the result is a
heavy lump, and this is the ordinary daily achievement of the
natives, who pack up their dough in leaves and bake it in
the ashes. The wheats of the Upper Nile Valley, and even
large Abyssinian kinds, have the same property, which may
arise from the small proportion of <em>soluble</em> starch which exists
in all corn of the tropics, however large the entire quantity
of the starch may be. The presence or absence of gluten in
the grain is irrelevant, and cannot be an adequate explanation
with regard to sorghum, of which the better kinds are
richer in gluten than our wheat.</p>

<p>Next, after the various sorts of corn, the leguminous plants
play an important part amongst this agricultural population.
Cultivated frequently alike by the Dinka and Dyoor is the
catyang (<i lang="la">Vigna sinensis</i>), which is grown by the Shillooks
more plentifully than by either; but the Bongo have a great
preference for the mungo-bean (<i lang="la">Phaseolus mungo</i>), which they
call “bokwa.” The pods of these contain a little hard
kernel, not unlike black pepper; in comparison with the
catyang they are very poor eating. Wild representatives of
both these classes of beans are almost universal throughout
Africa, and demonstrate that they are indigenous to the soil.
The best of all the beans is the <i lang="la">Phaseolus lunatus</i>, which is
found of various colours, white, or brown, or yellow, and which
in shape is like our own, although the legume is very short,
and rarely contains more than two seeds. This is grown
very freely by the Mittoo and the Madi, but the Bongo and
the Dinka also give it their attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
There are two kinds of these leguminous plants which are
cultivated very extensively, and which fructify below the soil,
that is, as the pods ripen the peduncles bend down and sink
beneath the ground. These are the speckled pea-shaped
voandzeia and the arachis, or earth-nut. Dispersed now
everywhere over the tropics, the proper home of these is in
Africa. The first is cultivated most of all by the Bongo;
the single seed which its pod contains is mealy, but cooking
does not soften it, and it is consequently very indigestible.</p>

<p>The earth-nut, on the contrary, is of an oily nature. It is
seldom wanting amongst any of the tribes; in value it is
almost a rival of the sesame, to the culture of which the
Bongo give their care next to their sorghum.</p>

<p>Another oily vegetable product of the country is the
<i lang="la">Hyptis spicigera</i>, which the Bongo named “kendee.” Once
sown among cultivated plants it becomes a sort of half-wild
growth, and establishes itself as an important shrub between
the stubble. The Bongo and Niam-niam especially store large
quantities of it. The tiny seeds, like those of a poppy-head,
are brayed to a jelly, and are used by the natives as an
adjunct to their stews and gravies, the taste and appearance
being very similar to the hemp-pap of the Lithuanians. Just
as poppy and hemp to the people of the North, so here to the
natives the sesame and the hyptis appear a natural product
so enjoyable that, without any preparation whatever, it can be
oaten from the hollow of the hand, according to Boccaccio’s
expression, “more avium.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFRICAN TUBERS.</div>

<p>A very subordinate place is occupied in the cultural pursuits
of these people by any of the tuberous vegetables.
Various kinds of yams (<i lang="la">Dioscorea alata</i>, and <i lang="la">D.</i> or <i lang="la">Helmia
bulbifera</i>) are found in the enclosures of the Bongo and
of the Dinka, and are here and there cultivated in some measure
like the maize, under the eye of the proprietor. The
Niam-niam and the Monbutto, who devote more attention to the
growth of tubers than of cereals, have a greater preference
for the sweet potato (<i lang="la">Batatas</i>), the manioc, and the colocasia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
and other bulbs, which to the northern people are quite
unknown. All the yams in these parts seem to exhibit
the same form, which is reckoned the most perfect in this
production, lavished by bountiful Nature on man with so
little labour on his
part. The tubers
of the Central
African species are
very long; at their
lower extremity
they have a number
of thick protuberances;
they are
similar to a human
foot, or rather (taking their size into account) to the great
foot of an elephant. Some were brought to me which varied
in weight from 50 to 80 lbs. The substance of the tuber,
which is easily cooked, is light, mealy, and somewhat granulated;
it is more loose in texture than our tenderest potatoes,
and decidedly preferable to them in flavour.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The Nyitti (<i lang="la">Helmia bulbifera</i>), which are protruded from
the axils of every leaf on the climbing sprouts, are in shape
like a great Brazil-nut—&#8203;a section of a sphere with a sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
edge. In their properties they correspond much with our
potato, particularly as regards their taste and their bulk; but
they never develop themselves into such mealy masses as
the ordinary yams. Their skin is remarkably like potato-peel,
and altogether their colour, sometimes yellow, sometimes
a thoroughly purple-brown, adds to the resemblance.
Very frequently these plants grow wild, but in that condition
the tubers are quite small, and have a taste so pungent
that they are said by the natives to be full of a dangerous
poison. To a kindred species which is found wild, and which
produces a horn-shaped tuber, we shall have to allude
hereafter.</p>

<p>Just before the sorghum-harvest commenced the gourds
were ripening, and came on as a welcome boon to the
natives, who at this season were suffering from the usual
scarcity. They devoured incredible quantities of them, and
I saw whole caravans of bearers literally fed upon them.
Of the ordinary gourds (<i lang="la">Cucurbita maxima</i>) there are two
kinds, the yellow and white, which succeed excellently and
attain a prodigious size. There is a kind of melon with a
hard woody rind, which the Dyoor and the Dinka cultivate:
when half-ripe, they cook and enjoy it as a palatable
vegetable; it is generally of a cylindrical form, and about a
foot in length. As it grows it assumes the diverse shape of
the <i lang="la">Cucumis chate</i>, the cooking-cucumber of the Egyptians,
which they call “adyoor” and “abdalowy;” by its wild
shapes it seems to reveal an African origin. The leaves of
the gourds are boiled just like cabbages, and are used for a
vegetable. The bottle-gourds do not grow anywhere here
actually without cultivation, but in a sort of semi-cultivation
they are found close to all the huts. From the edible kinds
are made vessels, which are quite secure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFRICAN VEGETABLES.</div>

<p>As actual vegetables the Bongo cultivate only the bamia
or waka of the Arabians (<i lang="la">Hibiscus esculentus</i>) and the sabdariffa.
The calyx of the latter is very large, varying in
colour from a pale flesh to a dark purple, and is used as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
a substitute for vinegar at meals. The bamia here is a
larger variety of the Oriental vegetable; its seed-vessels
before they are ripe are gathered and boiled.</p>

<p>Altogether unknown throughout the population of pagan
negroes is the onion, which appears to have its southern
limit in Kordofan and Darfoor. The equatorial climate seems
to render its growth very difficult, and do what the Nubians
will, they are unable successfully to introduce this serviceable
vegetable into the districts of their Seribas. The
tomato may well be considered as a cosmopolite, making
itself at home in all warmer latitudes, but previously to my
arrival it had not found its way into this region.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br>
 <img src="images/i_253.jpg"
 alt="Hibiscus esculentus">
 <p class="caption">Calyx of the Hibiscus esculentus.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>For the sake of its fibres the <i lang="la">Hibiscus cannabinus</i> is very
generally cultivated here, as it is in the Nile Valley; but
I observed that the Bongo have another plant, the crotalaria,
an improvement upon the wild sort (<i lang="la">C. intermedia</i>),
from which they make excellent string.</p>

<p>Compared with Africa in general, this district seemed very
deficient in the growth of those spices which serve as stimulants
to give a relish and variety to dishes at meals. Red
cayenne pepper, for instance, is swallowed by Abyssinians
and Nubians in incredible quantities in their soups, but
the Bongo regard it as little better than absolute poison.
Although the first-comers found the indigenous pimento
growing in all the enclosures, yet the Bongo reckoned it as
so dangerous that they carefully kept it in guarded spots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
so that their children might not be victims to the deleterious
effects of its bright red berries. The natives had been
accustomed to poison their arrows with pimento, and I may
mention this as one of the numerous proofs which might be
alleged that much of the arrow-poisoning of Africa is quite
a matter of imagination. When the natives witnessed the
Nubians come and gather up the suspected berries and throw
them into their food, their astonishment was unbounded;
they came at once to the conclusion that it was utterly
useless to contend with a people that could gulp down
poison by the spoonful, and accordingly they submitted
unconditionally to the intruders.</p>

<p>Of all the plants which are cultivated by these wild
people, none raises a greater interest than tobacco, none
exhibits a more curious conformity of habit amongst peoples
far remote. The same two kinds which are cultivated
amongst ourselves have become most generally recognised.
These kinds are the Virginian tobacco (<i lang="la">Nicotiana tabacum</i>)
and the common tobacco (<i lang="la">N. rustica</i>). It is little short
of a certainty that the Virginian tobacco has only made
its way into the Old World within the few centuries since
the discovery of America. No production more than this
has trampled over every obstacle to its propagation, so
that it has been kept to no limits; and it must be matter
of surprise that even Africa (notorious as it has ever been
for excluding every sort of novelty in the way of cultivation)
should have allowed the Virginian tobacco to penetrate
to its very centre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOBACCO.</div>

<p>It is a great indication of the foreign origin of this plant
that there is not a tribe from the Niger to the Nile which
has a native word of their own to denote it. Throughout
all the districts over which I travelled, the Niam-niam
formed the solitary exception to this by naming the Virginian
tobacco “gundeh;” but the Monbuttoo, who grow
only this one kind and are as little familiar with <i lang="la">N. rustica</i>
as the Niam-niam, call it “Eh-tobboo.” The rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
people ring every kind of change upon the root word, and
call it “tab, tabba, tabdeet,” or “tom.” The plant is remarkable
here for only attaining a height of about eighteen
inches, for its leaves being nearly as long as one could
span, and for its blossoms being invariably white.</p>

<p>Quite an open question I think it is, whether the <i lang="la">N.
rustica</i> is of American origin. Several of the tribes had
their own names for it. Here amongst the Bongo, in distinction
from the “tabba,” it was known as “masheer.”
The growth it makes is less than in Europe, but it is distinguished
by the extreme strength and by the intense
narcotic qualities which it possesses. It is different in this
respect from what is grown in Persia, where it is used for
the narghileh or water-pipes, and whence there is a large
export of it, because of its mildness and aromatic qualities.
Barth<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> has given his opinion that the tobacco is a native of
Logane (Mosgoo). At all events, the people of Africa have
far surpassed every other people in inventing various contrivances
for smoking, rising from the very simplest apparatus
to the most elaborate; and thus the conjecture is
tenable, that they probably favoured the propagation of
the foreign growth, because smoking, either of the common
tobacco (<i lang="la">N. rustica</i>) or of some other aromatic weed, had in
some way already been a practice amongst them. To such
a hypothesis might be opposed the important fact that on
all the monuments of the ancient Egyptians that afford us
so clear an insight into the details of their domestic life,
there has never been found a written inscription or pictorial
representation that could possibly afford a proof that such a
custom was known to exist. In conclusion, it deserves to
be mentioned that the pagan negroes, as far as they have
remained uninfluenced by Islamism, smoke the tobacco
whilst those who have embraced Mohammedanism prefer the
chewing of the leaf to the enjoyment of a pipe.</p>

<p class="footnote unindent"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> In all descriptions of sorghum, as given by travellers, there seems to be a
considerable confusion with respect to the distinctive names of this ordinary
cereal. It is called promiscuously “Kaffir-corn,” “negro-cane,” “bushel-maize,”
“Moorish-mille,” or sometimes “durra.” Durra is an Arabic definition,
which can be traced in literature as far as the tenth century. The
etymology of the Italian word <i lang="it">sorgho</i> is altogether uncertain. Peter de
Crescentiis, about the year 1300, is the first author who definitely alludes to
corn under this name; whether Pliny meant to refer to it is very doubtful.
The Germans in the South Tyrol, who are very limited in their acquaintance
with cultivated cereals, call it, in their Germanised way, “Sirch,” whilst the
Sclavonians corrupt it further into “Sirek.” In Egypt this sorghum is
called <i lang="la">Durra belladi</i>, “durra of the country,” to distinguish it from maize,
which is known as <i lang="la">Durra Shahmi</i>, or “Syrian durra.” In Syria itself, where
the sorghum is little known, because rarely cultivated, it is simply called
“durra.” Throughout the Soudan it has exclusively the appellation of
<i lang="la">Aish</i>, <i>i.e.</i> “bread.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I purpose</span> in this chapter to describe a people which, though
visibly on the decline, may still by its peculiarity and
striking independence in nationality, language, and customs,
be selected from amid the circle of its neighbours as a
genuine type of African life. Belonging to the past as
much as to the present, without constitution, history, or
definite traditions, it is passing away, like deeds forgotten
in the lapse of time, and is becoming as a drop in the vast
sea of the Central African races. But just as a biographer,
by depicting the passions, failings, and virtues of a few
individuals, may exhibit a representation of an entire epoch
in history, so we may turn with interest to scenes which
have been enacted in this limited district of the great and
mysterious continent, sure of finding much edifying matter
in the course of our investigations. Like the rain-drop
which feeds the flowing river and goes its way to replenish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
the mighty ocean, every separate people, however small,
has its share in the changes which supervene in the progress
of nations; there is not one which is without an
abstract bearing on the condition of primitive Africa, and
which may not aid us in an intelligent survey of any perspective
that may be opened into its still dark interior.</p>

<p>To the antiquary, within whose province the description
may lie in a degree, the material that is offered must be in
a measure attractive. A people, as long as they are on
the lowest step of their development, are far better characterised
by their industrial products than they are either
by their habits, which may be purely local, or by their own
representations, which (rendered in their rude and unformed
language) are often incorrectly interpreted by ourselves.
If we possessed more of these tokens, we should be in a
position to comprehend better than we do the primitive
condition of many a nation that has now reached a high
degree of culture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COUNTRY OF THE BONGO.</div>

<p>Of all the natives with whom I had intercourse in my
wanderings, the majority of those who acted as my bearers,
and amongst whom I most frequently sojourned, were the
Bongo. It was in their territory that I spent the greater
part of my time in the interior; and thus it happened that
I became intimate with many particulars of their life, was
initiated into all their habits, and even to a certain extent
mastered their dialect.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The present country of the Bongo lies between lat. 6°
and 8° <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> on the south-western boundary of the depression
of the Bahr-el-Ghazal basin, and on the lowest of the
terraces where the southern slopes appear to make a transition
from the elevated ferruginous crust to the unfathomed
alluvial flats which are traversed by all the affluents of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
the river. In the extent of its area the land covers about
the same surface as Belgium, but with regard to population,
it might be more aptly compared to the plains of Siberia or
the northern parts of Norway and Sweden; it is a deserted
wilderness, averaging only 11 or 12 people to the square mile.
The country extends from the Roah to the Pango, and
embraces the middle course of nearly all the affluents of
the Gazelle; it is 175 miles long by 50 miles broad, but
towards the north-west the breadth diminishes to about
40 miles. On the north it is only divided by the small
Dyoor country from that of the Dinka, which, however, it
directly joins upon the north-east. The south-east boundary
is the Mittoo territory on the Roah; and that on the west
is the country of the Golo and Sehre on the Pango. The
eastern branch of the extensive Niam-niam lands joins the
Bongo on the south; whilst, wedged between and straitly
pressed, the Bellanda and the Babuckur have their settlements.</p>

<p>When, eighteen years ago, the Khartoomers first set foot
in Bongoland, they found the entire country divided into
a number of independent districts, all in the usual anarchy
of petty African communities; there was nothing anywhere
like an organised commonwealth such as may be found
amongst the Dinka, where entire districts unite and form
an imposing warlike tribe. Every village simply had its
chief, who, in virtue of superior wealth, exercised a certain
authority over the rest of the inhabitants, and who, in some
cases, had an additional <i lang="fr">prestige</i> from his skill in the art
of magic. The Nubians, consequently, never had to contend
against the unanimous hostility of a powerful or well-disciplined
people, and only in a few isolated places had
to encounter much resolute opposition. Their soldiers, not
merely by the tenor of their religion, conceived themselves
justified in perpetrating every sort of outrage upon heathen
unbelievers, but they were taught to consider their acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
of violence as meritorious in the sight of God: it was,
therefore, an easy matter for them to fall upon the weak
authorities of the country, and in the space of a few years
to apportion the entire territory amongst the few ivory
merchants in Khartoom, whose spirit of enterprise, suddenly
kindled by the exaggerated reports of the profits secured
on the Upper Nile by Europeans, the first explorers, had
developed itself into a remarkable activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VASSALAGE.</div>

<p>The natives were without difficulty reduced to a condition
of vassalage, and, in order that they might be under the
close supervision and at the service of their oppressors, they
were compelled to quit their homes, and to reside near the
Seribas that were established in various parts of the land.
By the application of this sort of feudal system, the trading
companies brought about the realisation of their project
for a permanent occupation of the country. Shut in by the
Niam-niam on the south and by the Dinka on the north,
Bongoland offered a twofold advantage for the establishment
of headquarters for the expeditions: in the first place, it
was in close proximity to the Mesheras, or landing-places;
and, secondly, by its advanced position towards the interior,
it afforded most ample opportunities for setting in operation
the contemplated excursions to the prolific ivory districts
of the south. The Dinka, hostile and intractable from the
first, had never given the intruders the smallest chance
of settling amongst them; while the Bongo, docile and
yielding, and addicted almost exclusively to agriculture,
had, on the other hand, contributed in no slight measure
to maintain the Seribas. If ever, now and again, they had
been roused to offer anything like a warlike opposition, they
had only too soon succumbed to the motto of the conquerors,
“Divide, et impera.”</p>

<p>The Dyoor, the Golo, the Mittoo, and other smaller tribes,
shared the fate of the Bongo, and in the short space of ten
years a series of more than eighty Seribas had arisen between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
the Rohl and the Beery. Scarcely half the population
escaped slavery, and that only by emigrating; a portion
took refuge amongst the Dinka on the north, and others
withdrew southwards to the Niam-niam frontiers, where
the isolated mountains enabled them to hold out for a
while. The Khartoomers, however, were not long in pursuing
them, and gradually displaced them even from this
position.</p>

<p>During the early years of their occupation, the Nubians
beyond a question treated the country most shamefully;
there are traces still existing which demonstrate that large
villages and extensive plots of cultivated land formerly
occupied the scene where now all is desolation. Boys and
girls were carried off by thousands as slaves to distant
lands; and the Nubians, like the <i lang="fr">parvenu</i> who looks upon
his newly-acquired wealth as inexhaustible, regarded the
territory as being permanently productive; they revelled
like monkeys in the durra-fields of Taka and Gedaref.
In course of time they came to know that the enduring
value of the possessions which they had gained depended
mainly on the physical force at their disposal; they began
to understand how they must look to the hands of the
natives for the cultivation of their corn, and to their legs
for the transport of their merchandise. Meanwhile, altogether,
the population must have diminished by at least
two-thirds. According to a careful estimate that I made
of the numbers of huts in the villages around the Seribas
and the numbers of bearers levied in the several districts,
I found that the population could not at most be reckoned
at more than 100,000, scattered over an area of nearly 9000
square miles.</p>

<p>On first landing from the rivers, the Khartoomers opened
up an intercourse with the Dinka, who did not refuse to
furnish them with bearers and interpreters for their further
progress into the interior, and it was from them that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
learnt the names of the different tribes. In Central Africa
every nation has a different designation for its neighbours
than that by which they are known among themselves;
and it is the same with the rivers, which have as many
names as the nations through whose territory they flow. In
this way the Nubians have adopted the Dinka appellations
of Dyoor for Lwoh, Niam-niam for Zandey, and Dohr for
Bongo. This last people always style themselves Bongo,
and the Khartoomers, since they have made their headquarters
in their territory, have discarded the Dinka name
of Dohr, and now always use the native term Bongo. According
to the Arabic form of expression, the plural of Dohr
is Derahn, and of Niam-niam it is Niamahniam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPLEXION OF THE BONGO.</div>

<p>The complexion of the Bongo in colour is not dissimilar
to the red-brown soil upon which they reside; the Dinka, on
the other hand, are black as their own native alluvium. The
circumstance is suggestive of Darwin’s theory of “protective
resemblance” among animals; and although in this instance
it may be purely accidental, yet it appears to be worthy of
notice. Any traveller who has followed the course of the
main sources of the White Nile into the heathen negro
countries, and who has hitherto made acquaintance only
with Shillooks, Nueir, and Dinka, will, on coming amongst
the Bongo, at once recognise the commencement of a new
series of races extending far onwards to the south. As trees
and plants are the children of the soil from which they
spring, so here does the human species appear to adapt
itself in external aspect to the red ferruginous rock which
prevails around. The jet-black Shillooks, Nueir, and Dinka,
natives of the dark alluvial flats, stand out in marked distinction
to the dwellers upon the iron-red rocks, who (notwithstanding
their diversity in dialect, in habit, or in mode
of life) present the characteristics of a connected whole.
Of this series the tribes which must be accounted the most
important are the Bongo, the Mittoo, the Niam-niam, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
the Kredy, all of which are equally remarkable for their
entire indifference to cattle-breeding. The whole of these,
especially the women, are distinguished for the reddish hue
of their skin, which in many cases is almost copper-coloured.
It cannot be denied that this red-brown complexion is never
entirely wanting, even amongst the darkest skins that are
found in the lowlands; but the difference between their
complexion and what is ordinarily observed among the
Bongo is only to be illustrated by the contrast in colour
between a camellia leaf in its natural condition and after its
epidermis has been removed.</p>

<p>Although amongst every race the tint of the complexion
is sure to deviate into considerable varieties of shade, yet,
from a broad estimate, it may be asserted that the general
tint remains unaltered, and that what may be denominated
the “ground tint” constitutes a distinctive mark separating
between race and race. Gustav Fritsch, in his work upon
the people of Southern Africa, has bestowed great attention
upon this subject, and by means of an ingenious table, arranged
according to the intensity of various shades of colour,
has very perspicuously explained the characteristics of the
Kaffirs, Hottentots, and Bochjesmen. As matter of fact,
among the Bongo may be seen individuals with their skin as
black as ebony; but yet this does not prevent the true ground
tint of their complexions being something essentially distinct
from any example that could occur among the true Ethiopians,
whether these might be light or dark. The evidence
of the distinction of which I speak, I have no doubt is altogether
very conclusive; and I have had many opportunities
of testing its reality in my observations at the various Seribas,
where half-castes are very numerous, being the offspring of
Nubians (including Bedouins in that category) and Bongo.</p>

<p>In taking a coloured likeness of a Bongo it is necessary
to use the deep red pigment known as Pompeian red very
freely. I was once in the studio of an artist at Rome who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
was painting in oil the likeness of a Bongo whom I had
brought to Europe. I could not help observing that he made
the ground-tint of the flesh quite of a liver colour (hepatic)
hue, whilst when he was portraying natives, either of Dongola
or of Berber, or even when he was depicting the true
Arabs, although their skins were equally dark, he did not
make use of red at all, but employed a kind of yellow for the
basis of the shades to follow. His proceeding appeared to
me an involuntary attestation to the distinction which really
exists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATURE OF THE BONGO.</div>

<p>Like the Niam-niam, Mittoo, and Kredy, the Bongo rarely
exceed a medium height. They differ, however, in several
respects from the Dinka and other people of the lowland
plains. Their prominent characteristics appeared to me to
consist in a more compact form of limb, a sharper development
of muscle, a wider formation of the skull, and generally
a preponderating mass in the upper part of the body. Of
83 men that I measured I did not find one who had attained
a height of 6 ft. 1 in., whilst the average height did not
appear to me to be more than 5 ft. 7 in. Dinka and Bongo
alike afforded very striking samples of the two great series
of races which they severally represented, and each displayed
the principal characteristics of their particular race
in their stature, their complexion, and their form of skull.
I cannot recall a single instance among the Bongo where the
skull was of the long but narrow shape that is all but universal
among the Dinka. Of many of these Bongo that I
measured, I should pronounce that they would require
to be classified as hardly removed from the lowest grade of
the Brachycephaly. They appear themselves to be aware of
this characteristic. I remember a discussion that once arose
about a little boy, too young to speak, as to whether he was
a Dinka or a Bongo. One of the interpreters, after minute
examination of the proportions of the child’s head, came to
an immediate, but decided, opinion that the boy was a Bongo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
and in answer to my inquiry as to the grounds on which he
so confidently based his decision, he explained that he judged
from the fact that the head was broad; he went on, moreover,
accompanying his words by corresponding gestures, to
say that the Bongo women, as soon as an infant is born, press
its head downwards, but the Dinka mothers, on the contrary,
compress the heads of their babies from the sides. Now,
although it is hardly credible that this manipulation on the
part of the mothers would have any permanent influence on
the conformation of the skulls of an entire nation, yet we may
accept the statement as a significant proof of the high estimation
in which the natives hold this attribute and token of
their race. It has been proved by experience that in the
most diverse nations of the earth, mothers will always be
ready to use external means to promote as far as they can
any signs of nationality in their offspring, ignorant of the
certainty that these signs would of themselves, without
assistance, be manifested eventually. In order to effect an
actual alteration in the shape of the skull, such as may be
observed amongst the Mongolian and American Indian tribes,
it is necessary to employ continuous and forcible pressure,
and to bind the head with straps and bandages from the
earliest infancy.</p>

<p>The hair of the Bongo offers no peculiarity, either with
regard to its culture or its growth, that can be deemed of
any special interest; it is short and curly; moreover, it is
of that woolly nature at which, in default of anything better,
the theorist who propounds the doctrine of the independent
and yet of the mutual connection of the heathen races
eagerly clutches. Corresponding to the numerous gradations
in complexion and formation of the skull are the varieties
in growth of the hair which are exhibited. Hair which is
thick and frizzly is common amongst every race that has
hitherto been discovered on African soil, and although there
are a few unimportant exceptions among the Arab tribes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
(the Sheigieh) who have settled in Nubia, and notwithstanding
that the hair of the Ethiopians, as well as that of
the North African people may be termed curly more appropriately
than woolly, yet straight hair is nowhere to be
found. The real distinctions, therefore, in the growth of the
hair in the nations of Central Africa consist in the colour
and length, which vary considerably in the different races;
beards predominate with some, whilst with others they fail
entirely. In common with most other people of the red soil,
the Bongo have hair which is perfectly black, but in its
length it is very different from that of the Niam-niam. On
the Niam-niam frontiers the Bongo have often tried to imitate
their neighbours by twisting and plaiting their hair, but
their attempts have been always a failure. Whiskers, beards,
and moustaches are cultivated in very rare cases, but the
hair never grows to a length much exceeding half-an-inch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPPLY OF WATER.</div>

<p>Bongoland is traversed from south to north by five important
tributaries of the Gazelle. With these are associated
a number of smaller rivulets which are not permanent streams;
nevertheless, from the pools which remain in their beds
throughout the dry season, they furnish a sufficient supply
of moisture to maintain the vegetation of the country. Water
for drinking never fails, although from November to the
end of March a fall of rain is quite exceptional. In cases of
necessity water can always be procured without much time
or trouble from those pools which survive the periodical
water-courses in the marshes. Dearth as a consequence of
prolonged drought appears to be a condition quite unknown;
certainly it has not occurred for the last ten years. The
crops are far more frequently injured by superabundant
moisture than by drought, and the continuance of wide
inundations has been followed by famine. Everything seems
to suggest the thought how easily rice might be cultivated
in the country.</p>

<p>The Bongo are essentially an agricultural people. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
the exception of some occasional hunting and some intermittent
periods devoted to fishing, they depend entirely upon
the produce of the soil for their subsistence. Their cultivated
plants have already been noticed in a previous chapter.
To agriculture men and women alike apply themselves,
devoting their greatest attention to the culture of their
sorghum. The amount of labour they bestow upon this
cereal is very large. The seed is lavishly broadcast into
trenches which have been carefully prepared for its reception,
and when it has germinated and made its appearance above
the ground, two or three weeks are spent in thinning the
shoots and in transplanting them away from the spots
where they are too thick; a system which experience has
shown can very advantageously be applied to maize. Very
few vegetables are cultivated, but for these the people find a
variety of substitutes in the wild plants and tubers which
abound. Everywhere throughout the tropics the Gynandropsis,
the Corchorus, and the Gieseckia grow close upon the
confines of the abodes of men, and the leaves of these, like
the leaves of the gourd, are frequently used as an ingredient
in soup. The fleshy leaves of the <i lang="la">Talinum roseum</i> are served
up in the same way as our spinach; and the tough foliage
of the Tirna-tree (<i lang="la">Pterocarpus</i>), as it becomes soft in the
process of boiling, is employed as a vegetable, and is really
sweet and tender. The fruit of the Hymenocardia, not
unlike that of the maple, has an acid flavour far from
unpleasant, and serves a similar purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FUNGUSES.</div>

<p>During the rainy season the country is very prolific in
many varieties of funguses. The Bongo have a great fancy
for them; they keep them till they are on the verge of
decay, and then dry and pound them. They use them for
the purpose of flavouring their sauces, which in consequence
are enriched by a <i lang="fr">haut goût</i>, which without depreciation may
perhaps be compared to rotten fish. Throughout the country
I never saw any funguses but what were perfectly edible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
and some of them I must confess were very palatable. The
natives call them all “Kahoo,” while to the larger species
they give the special name of “hegba-mboddoh,” which is
synonymous with the Low German “poggen staul,” or with
the English “toad-stool.” “Hegba” is the name which the
Bongo give to their little carved stools, and “mboddoh” is
the generic term for all frogs and toads, and the proper
designation for the <i lang="la">Bufo pandarinus</i> in particular. This
“hegba-mboddoh,” which has thus suggested the same idea
in very remote parts of the world, is here a gigantic Polyporus;
not unfrequently specimens may be found of it which
grow to a height of nine inches, are a foot in diameter and
weigh nearly fifty pounds. In form, size, and colour they
are not unlike the grey clay edifices of the <i lang="la">Termes mordax</i>, of
which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. The funguses
which are most common, and which moreover are the most
preferred, are the different species of Coprinus, Marasmius,
Rhodosporus, and the tough but aromatic Lentinus.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the great abundance of edible, if
not always palatable, fruit which is produced by the common
trees of the country. In clearing the woods for their
tillage the Bongo are always careful to leave as many of
these trees as they can, and by thus sparing them they
preserve many a noble ornament to their fields, which would
otherwise be as monotonous as they are flat. The Butter-tree
and the Parkia are very carefully in this way saved from
destruction, and form a striking feature in many of their
landscapes. It is a remarkable peculiarity of the flora of
this region that all the species which are not essentially
shrubby or arborescent strive for a perennial existence; and,
as evidence of this, it may be observed that the roots and
portions of the stem beneath the soil either develop into
bulbs and tubers, or exhibit a determination to become
woody. Annuals occupy a very insignificant place, and all
vegetation seems to be provided with a means of withstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
the annual steppe-burning, and of preserving the germs
of life until the next period of vitality recurs. When their
corn provision is exhausted, or when there is a failure in the
harvest, then do the Bongo find a welcome resource in these
tubers; they subsist upon them for days in succession, and
find in them the staple of their nourishment whenever they
go upon their marches in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Quite incredible is it what the Bongo are able to digest.
Most of the bulbs and tubers are so extremely bitter that it
is not until they have been thoroughly steeped in boiling
water or have had their pungent matter mollified by being
roasted at a fire, that they can be eaten at all; they are gall
to the taste. Amongst these bitter bulbs there are two
which may claim a special notice; these are the Mandibo
and the Moddobehee. The Mandibo is a species of Coccinea,
which is nearly everywhere very abundant; the Moddobehee
(dog’s gum) is one of the Eureiandræ; they are both Cucurbitaceæ,
and both contain poisonous matter. Impregnated
with the like bitterness are the rape-like roots of the Asclepiadeæ,
the huge tubers of the <i lang="la">Entada Wahlbergii</i>, and of
the Pachyrrhizus; so also are the various kinds of Vernoniæ
and Flemingiæ, which are dug up from a foot below the surface
of the soil.</p>

<p>The natives can make but little use of the plants which
grow from any of these numerous tubers. The diminutive
Drimia lifts its pretty red blossoms about a couple of inches
above the rocky ground, and is a bulbous plant which becomes
edible after a prolonged boiling.</p>

<p>Whenever a halt is made upon the marches across the
wilderness, the bearers, as soon as they are liberated from
their burdens, set very vigorously to work and grub up all
sorts of roots from the nearest thickets. I can myself vouch
for a fact, which might fairly be deemed incredible, that
thirty Bongo who accompanied me on my return to Sabby,
at a time when I had scarcely enough to keep me from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
starvation, subsisted for six consecutive days entirely on these
roots, and although we were hurrying on by forced marches,
they lost neither their strength nor their spirits. Their
constitution was radically sound, and they seemed formed to
defy the treatment of their inhospitable home.</p>

<p>Already it has been mentioned that there is an entire
deficiency of common salt throughout the district of the
Gazelle. The alkali that is everywhere its substitute is
obtained by soaking the ashes of the burnt wood of the
<i lang="la">Grewia mollis</i>, a shrub common throughout Bongoland, and
which is notoriously useful in another way by the quantity
of bast which it produces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SMOKING AMONG THE BONGO.</div>

<p>Tobacco is indispensable to the Bongo, and is universally
cultivated. The species known as Mashirr (<i lang="la">Nicotiana rustica</i>)
is very pungent; its small thick leaves are pounded in a
mortar, and are subsequently pressed and dried in moulds.
From the cakes thus formed, the natives break off fragments
as they require them, grind them into powder by means of
stones, and smoke the preparation in long pipes that have
very pretty clay bowls. They are addicted to smoking quite
as inveterately as many of the nations that live in the polar
regions, and are not content until they are utterly stupefied
by its effects. I had a circumstance brought under my
notice which exhibited to me the extreme to which they can
carry their abuse of the narcotic: upon one of our marches a
Bongo man had indulged to such excess, and had inhaled the
pungent fume so long, that he fell senseless into a campfire,
and was taken up so severely burnt that he had to be
carried by his comrades on a litter for the remainder of the
journey.</p>

<p>The Bongo fashion of smoking is even more disgusting
than that which has been already described as prevalent
amongst the Dinka. In the same manner as with them, the
pipe is passed from hand to hand, but the lump of bast that
intercepts the pungent oil is not placed in the receptacle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the stem, but is put in the mouth of the smoker, and together
with the pipe is passed from one person to another. The
habit of chewing tobacco is adopted as much by the Bongo
as by the Mohammedan inhabitants of Nubia; but the
custom is so universal that there would seem to be ample
justification for the belief that it is indigenous rather than
what has been acquired from foreigners. The practice in
which the Bongo indulges of placing his tobacco quid behind
his ear is very repulsive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO GOATS.</div>

<p>It is to their indifference to cattle-breeding, like what
is practised so extensively by the Dinka, that the Bongo
owe their comparatively peaceful relations with the so-called
“Turks.” It is to the same cause that the latter are indebted
for the sluggish measure of opposition shown them by their
vassals. The domestic animals of the Bongo are poultry,
dogs, and goats; sheep being almost as rare as cattle. The
goats are unlike those of the Dinka, but are of a breed quite
common throughout these regions of Central Africa. Not
only did I see them amongst the Mittoo and Madi, but likewise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
among the Babuckur, and even in the country of the
Monbuttoo, whither they had been brought by the equatorial
nations whom the Monbuttoo simply style the “Momvoo.”
These goats, like the Dinka sheep, are distinguished by
a hairy appendage from the breast and shoulders, and by a
short stiff mane, which runs right along the ridge of the
back to the small erect tail. The frontal is round, and
projects considerably beyond the base of the nasal bone, and
the horns are very strong and but slightly curved. The
ordinary colour of these pretty animals is a light fawn or
chamois-brown, the mane being very dark. I occasionally
found the Bongo in possession of another breed which I met
with nowhere else, and which is probably merely a cross
with the Dinka goat. It has a remarkably short and plump
body, and is generally of a pepper-and-salt colour. The
coat is somewhat longer and more shaggy than that of the
other breed, and besides the mane-like appendage in front
the hind quarters are also covered with long rough hair.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The Bongo dogs, with regard to size, are between the
small Niam-niam race and the Dinka breed, which corresponds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
more nearly to the common pariah of Egypt. On account
of the indiscriminate crossing of the races, a dog of pure
Bongo breed is somewhat rare; its chief characteristics are
a reddish tan colour, short erect ears, and a bushy tail like a
fox’s brush. Their greatest peculiarity appeared to me to
be the bristling of their hair, which at every provocation
stands up along the back and neck like that of an angry cat.
The bushiness of the tail distinguishes the breed from the
smooth-tailed Dinka dog, and from that of the Niam-niam, of
which the tails are as curly as pigtails.</p>

<p>Although the Bongo are not over choice in their food, they
persistently abstain from eating dog’s flesh, a practice to
which their southern and south-eastern neighbours are notoriously
addicted; in fact, they show as much abhorrence at
the idea as they would at devouring human flesh itself.
They have a curious superstition about dead dogs. I was
about to bury one of my dogs that had recently died, and
some of the men came and implored me to desist from my
intention, since the result would assuredly be that no rain
would fall upon their seeds. For this reason all the Bongo
simply throw their dead dogs out into the open fields.</p>

<p>At some seasons, especially at the end of the rainy months,
fishing and hunting offer productive sources for obtaining
the means of subsistence. Hunting is sometimes practised
by independent individuals going out separately; but at
other times it takes the form of an extensive <i lang="fr">battue</i>, in which
the men belonging to a whole district will combine to take a
share. Occasionally, too, a rich booty is obtained from the
trenches and snares. Nets are used in all the <i lang="fr">battues</i> for
game, and the Bongo devote as much attention to the construction
of these nets as they do to the weaving of their
fish-snares and basket-pots. Their fishery is principally
limited to the winter months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUNTING-SNARES.</div>

<p>Elephant-hunting has for the last twelve years been
among the things of the past. It is only the oldest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
men—&#8203;and here the number of the men that are really old
is very small—&#8203;who appear to have any distinct recollection
of it at all. The huge lance-heads, which are now only
weapons of luxury in the possession of the wealthy, or upon
some rare occasions used for buffalo-hunting, are the sole
memorials of the abundance of ivory of which Petherick, as an
eye-witness, has given so striking a description. The snares
by which the Bongo succeed in catching the smaller kinds
of game generally consist of the stem of a tree balanced
horizontally by means of ropes.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> A spot which the game is
known to haunt is selected for the erection of these snares;
a hedge, or some sort of enclosure, is set up on each side of
the tree so that the game may be obliged to run underneath:
it is arranged so that the animals as they pass tread upon a
kind of noose or slip-knot which slackens the ropes by which
the tree is suspended, and the falling weight crushes and
kills the game below. The numbers of snares of this description
which are found in the bush-thickets is a sufficient proof
of their efficacy. The smaller species of antelopes, ichneumons,
civets, genets, wild cats, servals, and caracals, are all
in turn caught by this stratagem.</p>

<p>Hunting on a minor scale is a very favourite recreation,
and the children find a daily amusement in catching rats
and field-mice. They weave baskets in the form of long
tubes, which they lay flat upon the ground in the immediate
neighbourhood of the mouse-holes; they then commence a
regular <i lang="fr">battue</i>, when the scared mice, scampering back to
regain their homes, run through the stubble, and often rush
into the open traps, where, like fish in a weir-basket, they
are easily secured. In this way the Bongo boys catch considerable
quantities of meriones, <i lang="la">Mus gentilis</i>, and <i lang="la">M. barbarus</i>,
which they tie together by their tails in clusters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
about a dozen, and barter them to each other as dainty
morsels. “These are our cows,” they would shout to me
with great glee whenever I met them returning after their
sport had been successful. Another use which is made of the
mice which are captured by this simple artifice is to employ
them for a bait for securing what they esteem the especial
delicacy of roast cat. On the narrow paths which traverse
the steppes like rifts in the long grass, they construct
diminutive huts out of some twisted reeds; by placing the
mice inside these they are very often able to entice the cats
into a snare.</p>

<p>With the exception of human flesh and the flesh of dogs,
the Bongo seem to consider all animal substance fit for
eating, in whatever condition it may be found. The putrefying
remnant of a lion’s feast, which lies in the obscurity of a
forest and is only revealed by the kites and vultures circling
in the air above, is to them a welcome discovery. That meat
is “high” is a guarantee for its being tender, and they deem
it in that condition not only more strengthening than when
it is fresh, but likewise more easy of digestion. There is,
however, no accounting for taste, certainly not with the
Bongo, who do not recoil from the most revolting of food.
Whenever my cattle were slaughtered, I always saw my
bearers eagerly contending for the half-digested contents of
the stomach, like the Esquimaux, whose only ideas of vegetables
appears to be what they obtain from the contents of
the paunches of their reindeers; and I have seen the Bongo
calmly strip off the disgusting amphistoma-worms which
literally line the stomachs of all the cattle of this region,
and put them into their mouths by handfuls. After that,
it was not a matter of surprise to me to find that the Bongo
reckons as game everything that creeps or crawls, from
rats and mice to snakes, and that he is not particular what
he eats, from the carrion vulture to the mangy hyæna, or
from the fat earth-scorpions (<i lang="la">Heterometrus palmatus</i>) to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
caterpillars of the winged termites with their oily beetle-bodies.</p>

<p>Having thus dilated with more minuteness than elsewhere
upon the external features of Bongo life, such as their agriculture,
hunting, and fishing, I may proceed to call attention
to those arts by which, even in this low grade of development,
man seeks to ameliorate and embellish his existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO DWELLINGS.</div>

<p>First of all, the dwelling-place may demand our notice,
that which binds every man more or less to the soil which
affords him his subsistence—&#8203;that family nucleus, from which
the wide-branching tree of human society has derived its
origin.</p>

<p>In the period when the Khartoomers first made their way
into the country, the Bongo, quite unlike the other tribes,
inhabited extensive villages, which, similar to the present
Seribas, were encompassed by a palisade. Neither towns
nor villages are now to be seen, and the districts which are
occupied at all are only marked by scattered enclosures and
little gatherings of huts, as in the country of the Dinka and
the Niam-niam. Very rarely are more than five or six
families resident in the same locality, so that it is almost an
exaggeration to speak of their being villages in any sense.
The communities in past times seem to have had a preference
for gathering round some great tamarind, ficus, or butter-tree,
which often still survives and constitutes the only relic
of habitations which have long fallen to decay; and even to
the present time the Bongo appear to retain this partiality, and
more often than not they may be found beneath the natural
shade of a spreading roof of foliage, enjoying the light and
space which are prohibited to their cramped and narrow
dwellings. The ground for a considerable circuit about the
huts is all well cleared and levelled, its surface being the
general scene of labour on which all the women perform
their ordinary domestic duties. The corn is there thrashed
and winnowed; there it is brayed in the wooden mortars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
or pounded by the mill; there are the leaves of the
tobacco plant laid out to dry; there stand the baskets with
the loads of mushrooms or supply of fruit; and there may
be seen the accumulated store of nutritious roots. Dogs
and poultry alike seem to revel in security under the majestic
covering, while the little children at their play complete
the idyllic picture of life in Central Africa.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Upon the erection of their dwellings there is no people in
the Gazelle district who bestow so much pains as the Bongo.
Although they invariably adopt the conical shape, they
allow themselves considerable diversity in the forms they
use. The general plan of their architecture has already
been sketched. The materials they employ are upright tree-stems,
plaited faggots, canes of the bamboo, clay from the
mushroom-shaped white-ant hills, and tough grass and the
bast of the Grewia.</p>

<p>The diameter of the dwellings rarely exceeds twenty-feet,
the height generally being about the same. The entrance
consists of a hole so small that it is necessary to creep
through in order to get inside; and the door consists of a
hurdle swung upon two posts so as to be pushed backwards
and forwards at pleasure. The clay floor in the interior is
always perfectly level; it is made secure against damp as
well as against the entrance of white ants by having been
flattened down by the women trampling upon broad strips
of bark laid upon it. The common sleeping-place of the
parents and smaller children is on the floor. The bedding
generally consists only of skins, the Bongo having little care
for mats. For the pillow of the family they ordinarily use
a branch of a tree smoothed by being stripped of its bark.</p>

<p>In every dwelling-place is found a conical receptacle for
corn, named the “gallotoh,” which is elevated on piles, varying
in height, so as to protect the provision from the damp of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
the soil or from the ravages of rats or white ants. Magazines
of this kind for the reserve of corn are in general use
throughout Africa, from the Rumboo of Damerghoo in the
Central Soudan, right into the country of the Kaffirs and
Bechuanas.</p>

<p>All the dwellings of the Bongo, whether large or small,
are marked by one characteristic, which might almost be
represented as a national feature. The peak of their huts is
always furnished with a circular pad of straw, very carefully
made, which serves as a seat, and from which it is possible
to take a survey of the country, covered with its tall growth
of corn. The name of “gony” is given to this elevation,
which is surrounded by six or eight curved bits of wood
projecting as though the roof were furnished with horns. It
is peculiar to the huts of the Bongo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABUNDANCE OF IRON.</div>

<p>Iron is found in such quantities throughout the region
that naturally the inhabitants devote much of their attention
to its manipulation; its very abundance apparently
secures them an advantage over the Dinka. Although,
according to our conceptions they would be described
as utterly deficient in tools and apparatus, still they
produce some very wonderful results, even surpassing the
Dyoor in skill. With their rude bellows and a hammer
which, more commonly than not, is merely a round ball of
pebble-stone (though occasionally it may be a little pyramid
of iron without a handle) upon an anvil of gneiss or granite,
with an ordinary little chisel and a pair of tongs consisting
of a mere split piece of green wood, they contrive to fabricate
articles which would bear comparison with the productions
of an English smith.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The season when opportunity is found for putting the iron-works
in motion is after the harvest has been housed and the
rains are over. Already, in a previous chapter,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> iron-work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
as produced by the Dyoor, has been noticed, but the Bongo
have a system considerably more advanced, which appears
worthy of a brief description. Their smelting apparatus is
an erection of clay, generally about five feet in height,
containing in its interior
three distinct compartments.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
These are all of the same size,
that in the middle being
filled with alternate layers of
fuel and ore. This centre
chamber is separated from the
lower by means of a kind of
frame resting on a circular
projection; and it is divided
from the chamber above by
a narrow neck of communication.
The highest and lowest
of the divisions are used for
fuel only. Round the base of
the inferior chamber there are
four holes, into which the “tewels” or pokers are introduced,
and to which bellows are applied to increase the intensity of
the combustion; there is a fifth hole, which can be stopped
with clay as often as may be desired, and which serves to
allow the metal to be raked out after it has trickled down
into the cavity below the frame.</p>

<p>The most important of the iron productions are designed
for the trade that the Bongo carry on with the tribes that
dwell in the north, and which some time since was very
active. The raw iron is exhibited in three separate shapes:
one is named “mahee,” being spear-heads of one or two feet
long, corresponding exactly with what has been mentioned
as common with the Dyoor; the second is known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
“loggoh kullutty,” and is simply a lot of black, ill-formed
spades; the third is called distinctively “loggoh,” consisting
of regular spades, which, under the market appellation of
“melot,” have a wide sale everywhere along the course of
the Upper Nile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO MONEY.</div>

<p>The “loggoh kullutty” is the circulating medium of the
Bongo, the only equivalent which Central Africa possesses
for money of any description; but, rough-shaped as it is, it
seems really to answer in its way the purpose of regular
coin. According to Major Denham, who visited the Central
Soudan in 1824, there were at that time some iron pieces
which were circulated as currency in Loggon on the Lower
Shary, answering to what is now in use among the Bongo;
but at the period of Barth’s visit all traces of their use had
long disappeared. The “loggoh kullutty” is formed in flat
circles, varying in diameter from 10 to 12 inches. On one
edge there is a short handle; on the opposite there is attached
a projecting limb, something in the form of an anchor. In
this shape the metal is stored up in the treasures of the rich,
and up to the present time it serves as well as the lance-heads
and spades for cash and for exchanges, being available
not only for purchases, but for the marriage portions which
every suitor is pledged to assign. The axe of the Bongo
consists of a flat, cumbrous wedge of iron, into the thick end
of which is inserted a knobbed handle; it is an instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
differing in no particular from what may be seen throughout
Central Africa.</p>

 <img src="images/i_280.jpg"
 alt="Bongo lances">
 <p class="caption">Bongo lances.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Besides these rough exhibitions of their craft, the Bongo
produce arms, tools, and ornaments of admirable quality, and,
at the instance of the controllers of
the Seribas, have manufactured chains
and manacles for the slave-traffic.
Very elegant, it might almost be
said artistic, is the work displayed
on the points of their arrows and
lances. The keen and (to use a
botanical expression) the “awny”
barbs and edges of these instruments,
to any one who is aware of the simple
means of production in their reach,
must be quite an enigma. The lances
are readily recognised by their shapes,
and may be classified in a threefold
way. First, there is the common
lancet-formed spear-head, which is
known as “mahee;” then, secondly,
there is the “golo,” a hastate sort
of spear, with long iron barbs below
the point extending along the stem
to which the wooden stock is attached;
whilst the third description is called
“makrigga,” and consists of a spike,
the stem of which is covered with a number of teeth
symmetrically arranged along it, sometimes upwards and
sometimes downwards. This makrigga is often merely an
article of show, and the technical skill of the smith is concentrated
upon its design. The name of makrigga is appropriated
to it from the <i lang="la">Randia dumetorum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> a prickly shrub,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
which is quite common in the district: seeming to indicate
that the pattern is derived from an object in nature, it affords
a fresh illustration of the view, that all human arts are only
imitations of what may be observed in the free fields of a
wide creation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO ORNAMENTS.</div>

<p>Equal care is bestowed upon the production of the iron
and copper ornaments which are worn and the cutlery which
is used by the women. For the purpose of plucking out
their eyebrows and eyelashes, they employ a pair of little
pincers called “peenoh,” of which an illustration is here introduced.
Quite peculiar to the Bongo women are their
“tibbah,” or elongated oval knives, with handles at either
end, which are sharpened on both edges, and which are often
very elaborate in their workmanship. These knives are in
constant use for all domestic purposes, being of especial service
in peeling their tubers and in slicing their gourds
and cucumbers. The rings, the bells, the clasps, the buttons,
whatever they affix to their projecting lips or attach
to the rims of their ears, the lancet-shaped hair-pins, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
appear indispensable to the decoration of the crown of their
head and to the parting of their locks, all are fabricated to
supply the demands of the Bongo women’s toilet.</p>

<p>The decoration of which the men are proudest is the
“dangabor,” which simply means “rings one above another.”
The Dinka and the Dyoor both have an ornament very similar
to this, composed of accumulated rings, which cover the
arm below the elbow; but the Bongo finish off their article
with much more elaborate work. Each separate ring is furnished
with a boss of a height and strength to correspond
with the ring next to it, the rings themselves being forged
so as to become gradually larger in proportion as they are
farther from the wrist. The arm is thus covered with what
may be described as a sleeve of mail, each ring of which
can be turned round or displaced at pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOODEN UTENSILS OF THE BONGO.</div>

<p>Hardly inferior to the skill of the Bongo in the working of
iron is their dexterity in wood-carving. Perhaps the most
striking specimens of their art in this way may be noticed in
the little low four-legged seats or stools which are found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
every household, and are called “hegba.” These are invariably
made from a single block, the wood chosen for the purpose
being that of the Göll-tree (<i lang="la">Prosopis lanceolata</i>, Benth.),
which is of a chestnut brown, and after use acquires an excellent
polish; they are used only by the women, who are
continually to be seen sitting on them in front of their huts,
but they are altogether avoided by the men, who regard
every raised seat as an effeminate luxury.</p>

<br>
 <img src="images/i_283.jpg"

 <p class="caption">Bongo stool.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Other articles of their fabric in wood are the pestles, the
troughs for oil-pressing, the flails for threshing corn, and,
most remarkable of all, the goblet-shaped mortars in which
the corn is bruised before it is ground into flour upon the
grinding-stones. Very graceful in shape are these mortars,
not unlike a drinking-goblet with a cut stem; they are not
sunk below the ground, as is ordinarily the case with those of
the Dinka and Dyoor, but they can be removed whenever it
is requisite from place to place. Their height is about thirty
inches. Mortars of very similar design were noticed by
Barth amongst the Musgoo, and they are also used by the
Ovambo, the Makololo, and other negro nations. They are
worked by two women at once, who alternately pound away
with heavy pestles in a regular African fashion, which has
been long immortalised by the pictorial representations of
ancient Egypt. Very cleverly, too, do the Bongo cut spoons
of very choice design out of horn, of the same shape as may
be found in nearly every market in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Consequent upon the oppression to which the Bongo have
now for years been subject, and the remorseless appropriation
of all their energies by the intruders, very many of the primitive
habits of the people were disappearing; and at the time
of my visit my attention was rather arrested by what were
memorials of a bygone and happier condition of things,
than by anything that was really done under my eyes. Just
as in the Central Soudan, in Borneo, and in the Tsad countries,
so here also the destructive power of Islamism has
manifested itself by obliterating, in comparatively a brief
space of time, all signs of activity and all traces of progress
of any kind. Wherever it prevails, it annihilates the
chief distinctions of race, it effaces the best vestiges of
the past, and extends, as it were, a new desert upon the
face of the land which it overruns. Those who have been
eye-witnesses of the state of things when the intruders first
broke in upon the country, gave me still further details of
what had been the special industries of the people.</p>

<p>In the villages there are found very frequently whole rows of
figures carved out of wood and arranged either at the entrances
of the palisaded enclosures, forming, as it were, a decoration
for the gateway, or set up besides the huts of the “Nyare”
(chiefs), as memorials, to immortalise the renown of some
departed character. In Moody, a district towards the
west, I came across the remains (still in a perfect state
of preservation) of an erection of this sort, which had been
reared above the grave of the Bongo chieftain Yanga. Large
as life, the rough-hewn figures represented the chief followed
in procession by his wives and children, apparently issuing
from the tomb. The curious conception of the separate individuals,
and the singular mode in which they were rendered
by the artist, awakened my keenest interest. The illustration
which is subjoined may be accepted as a faithful representation
of the first rude efforts of savages in the arts of
sculpture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO GRAVES.</div>

<p>Plastic representations of men are known generally by the
name of “Moiogohgyee:” when I first saw them, I was under
the impression that they must be idols, similar to what the
Fetish-worship has introduced into the western coasts, but
I soon satisfied myself of my misconception in this respect.
The true design of these wooden figures is simply to be
a memorial of some one who has departed this life: this is
proved by the term “Moiagoh Komarah,” <i>i.e.</i>, the figure of
the wife, which is applied to an image raised by a surviving
husband to the pious memory of his departed wife, and which
is set up in the hut as a species of Penates. However rude
these attempts must be pronounced, they nevertheless reveal
a kind of artistic power certainly far from contemptible; at
any rate, the very labour bestowed upon them indicates the
appreciation which the artist entertained for his work. The
Bongo, for their own part, regard their wooden images as
incomparably superb, and persuade themselves that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
likenesses of those who are represented are perfect. To
complete the illusion, they very often deck the figure with
bead-necklaces and rings and affix some hair over the appropriate
parts of the body. Travellers in Central Africa have
narrated that they have seen figures of wood corresponding
to what I have described, but although they have almost
universally taken them for carved deities, I would venture
to suggest that in all probability they are elsewhere monuments
of the dead, in the same way as among the Bongo.</p>

<p>In addition it may be mentioned that a custom exists of
raising a monument of this kind to preserve the memory of
any <em>male</em> person who has been murdered. I was made
acquainted with this circumstance by the mouth of one of the
national authorities, who depicted to me the peculiar custom
of his fathers in a narrative to the following effect. He said
that murder and manslaughter used to be the order of the
day at all their festivals and drinking-bouts; when the harvest
had been abundant and the granaries were well-stored
with corn, there used to be no bounds to their licentiousness;
there was no respect for the Nyare, and his words
were disregarded amidst the blows of the Nogarra. Now
the “Turks” would punish a murderer by carrying off his
wife and children, and compel him to pay a heavy fine
in iron and make some compensation to the relatives:
but formerly the friends would take the law into their
own hands, and proceed to exact personal punishment,
though they had to set to work very warily if they would
keep themselves out of difficulty. When anyone discovered
that either his friend, or it might be his brother, or perhaps
his wife, had been killed, and the criminal could not
be detected, it was no unknown device to prepare beforehand
an image carefully representing the murdered person,
and very often the likeness would be singularly perfect. He
would then invite all the men to a feast, at which the spirituous
“legyee” would be freely circulated; and then, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
the excitement was at its height, in the very midst of the
singing and dancing, he would unexpectedly introduce the
figure that had been prepared. The apparition would be
sure to work its effect; the culprit would not fail to be
betrayed, as he cowed and exhibited his wish to slink away.
Having thus detected the offender, the injured party could
deal with him as he pleased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO MUSIC.</div>

<p>The Bongo, in their way, are enthusiastic lovers of music;
and although their instruments are of a very primitive
description, and they are unacquainted even with the pretty
little guitar of the Niam-niam, which is constructed on perfectly
correct acoustic principles, yet they may be seen at any
hour of the day strumming away and chanting to their own
performances. The youngsters, down to the small boys, are
all musicians. Without much trouble, and with the most
meagre materials, they contrive to make little flutes; they
are accustomed also to construct a monochord, which in its
design reminds one of the instrument which (known as the
“gubo” of the Zulus) is common throughout the tribes of
Southern Africa. This consists of a bow of bamboo, with the
string tightly strained across it, and this is struck by a slender
slip of split bamboo. The sounding board is not, however,
made of a calabash attached to the ground, but the
mouth of the player himself performs that office, one end of
the instrument being held to the lips with one hand, while
the string is managed with the other. Performers may often
be seen sitting for an hour together with an instrument of
this sort: they stick one end of the bow into the ground, and
fasten the string over a cavity covered with bark, which
opens into an aperture for the escape of the sound. They
pass one hand from one part of the bow to the other, and
with the other they play upon the string with the bamboo
twig, and produce a considerable variety of buzzing and
humming airs which are really rather pretty. This is quite
a common pastime with the lads who are put in charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
the goats. I have seen them apply themselves very earnestly
and with obvious interest to their musical practice, and the
ingenious use to which they apply the simplest means for
obtaining harmonious tones testifies to their penetration into
the secrets of the theory of sound.</p>

<p>As appeals, however, to the sense of sound, the great
festivals of the Bongo abound with measures much more
thrilling than any of these minor performances. On those
occasions the orchestral results might perhaps be fairly
characterised as cat’s music run wild. Unwearied thumping
of drums, the bellowings of gigantic trumpets, for the manufacture
of which great stems of trees come into requisition,
interchanged by fits and starts with the shriller blasts of
some smaller horns, make up the burden of the unearthly
hubbub which re-echoes miles away along the desert.
Meanwhile, women and children by the hundred fill gourd-flasks
with little stones, and rattle them as if they were
churning butter: or again, at other times, they will get some
sticks or dry faggots and strike them together with the greatest
energy. The huge wooden tubes which may be styled the
trumpets of the Bongo are by the natives themselves called
“manyinyee;” they vary from four to five feet in length, being
closed at the extremity, and ornamented with carved work
representing a man’s head, which not unfrequently is adorned
with a couple of horns. The other end of the stem is open,
and in an upper compartment towards the figure of the
head is the orifice into which the performer blows with
all his might. There is another form of manyinyee which
is made like a huge wine-bottle; in order to play upon it,
the musician takes it between his knees like a violoncello,
and when the build of the instrument is too cumbrous, he
has to bend over it as it lies upon the ground.</p>

<p>Little difference can be noticed between the kettle-drums
of the Bongo and those of most other North African negroes.
A section is cut from the thick stem of a tree, the preference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
being given to a tamarind when it can be procured; this
is hollowed out into a cylinder, one end being larger than
the other. The ends are then covered with two pieces of
goat-skin stripped of the hair, which are tightly strained
and laced together with thongs. At the nightly orgies a
fire is invariably kept burning to dry the skin and to
tighten it when it has happened to become relaxed by the
heavy dews.</p>

<p>A great number of signal-horns may be seen made from
the horns of different antelopes; these are called “mangoal,”
and have three holes like small flutes, and in tone are not
unlike fifes. There is one long and narrow pipe cut by the
Bongo out of wood which they call a “mburrah,” and which
has a widened air-chamber close to the mouth-piece, very
similar to the ivory signal-horns which are so frequently to
be seen in all the negro countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO SINGING.</div>

<p>Difficult were the task to give any adequate description
of the singing of the Bongo. It must suffice to say that it
consists of a babbling recitative, which at one time suggests
the yelping of a dog and at another the lowing of a cow,
whilst it is broken ever and again by the gabbling of a
string of words which are huddled up one into another.
The commencement of a measure will always be with a
lively air, and every one, without distinction of age or sex,
will begin yelling, screeching, and bellowing with all their
strength; gradually the surging of the voices will tone
down, the rapid time will moderate, and the song be hushed
into a wailing, melancholy strain. Thus it sinks into a
very dirge, such as might be chanted at the grave, and be
interpreted as representative of a leaden and a frowning
sky, when all at once, without note of warning, there
bursts forth the whole fury of the negro throats; shrill
and thrilling is the outcry, and the contrast is as vivid as
sunshine in the midst of rain.</p>

<p>Often as I was present at these festivities I never could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
prevent my ideas from associating Bongo music with the
instinct of imitation, which belongs to men universally. The
orgies always gave me the impression of having no other
object than to surpass in violence the fury of the elements.
Adequately to represent the rage of a hurricane in the
tropics any single instrument of course must be weak,
poor, and powerless, consequently they hammer at numbers
of their gigantic drums with powerful blows of their heavy
clubs. If they would rival the bursting of a storm, the
roaring of the wind, or the splashing of the rain, they
summon a chorus of their stoutest lungs; whilst to depict
the bellowings of terrified wild beasts, they resort to their
longest horns; and to imitate the songs of birds, they bring
together all their flutes and fifes. Most characteristic of
all, perchance, is the deep and rolling bass of the huge
“manyinyee,” as descriptive of the rumbling thunder.
The penetrating shower may drive rattling and crackling
among the twigs, and amid the parched foliage of the
woods, and this is imitated by the united energies of women
and children, as they rattle the stones in their gourd-flasks,
and clash together their bits of wood.</p>

<p>It remains still to notice some examples of the various
handicrafts which are practised by this people. Compared
with other nations, the Bongo are remarkable for the attention
they give to basket-work. They make (very much
after the fashion of a coffee-bag) a strainer to filter and
clarify their “legyee,” which is a drink something like
ale fermented from sorghum. Baskets are roughly yet
substantially made by twining together the stems of the
bamboo. As their first efforts in this line, the natives are
accustomed to make the circular envelopes in which they
pack their corn for exportation. They take the coriaceous
leaves of the Combreta and Terminaliæ, and by inserting
the petiole of one leaf into the laminæ of two others, they
form strips of leaves which in a few minutes are made into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
a kind of basket, equally strong and flexible, which answers
its purpose admirably.</p>

<p>Woven matting is very rarely found in use. The walls
of every hut are made of basket-work, as are the beehives,
which are more often than not under the shadow of some
adjacent butter-tree. Generally these hives are long cylinders,
which midway have an opening about six inches square.
The yield of honey, wild or half-wild, is very large, and of
fine quality: the bees belong to the European species. The
aroma of the Gardenia flowers is retained to a very palpable
degree, but wherever the Candelabra-euphorbia happens to
be abundant, the honey partakes of the drastic properties
of its poisonous milk, and has been the cause of the
natives being reproached with the intention of poisoning
the Nubians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO FISHING.</div>

<p>In consequence of the people being so much engrossed
at certain periods of the year by their hunting and fishing,
the manufacture of fish-nets, creels, and snares, makes an
important item in their industrial pursuits. For the most
part all the twist, the bird-snares, and the fishing-lines are
made from the fibres of bast, which are so plentiful in the
cultivated Crotalaria and the Hibiscus. For inferior purposes
the common lime-like bast of the <i lang="la">Grewia mollis</i> is
made to suffice. The <i lang="la">Sanseviera guineensis</i> is not less
abundant, but the bast which it yields, although very fine,
is not very enduring. It is generally very black through
having been left to lie upon the dark soil of the marshes,
and is only used for making a kind of kilt like a horse’s
tail, which the women wear behind from a girdle about their
waist. Cotton-shrubs are planted only by the Dinka, who
make their fishing-lines of the material which is thus
provided.</p>

<p>The manufacture of the pottery all falls to the care of
the women, who do not shrink from the most difficult
tasks, and, without the help of any turning-wheel, succeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
in producing the most artistic specimens. The larger water-bottles
are sometimes not less than a yard in diameter.
The clay water-pots are ordinarily of a broad oval shape,
adapted for being carried on the head with the narrow
end resting on a kind of porter’s knot, which is made
either of leaves or plaited straw. Handles are uniformly
wanting: for, whatever may be the purpose to which the
vessels are applied, whether for holding water or oil, for
boiling or for baking, the material of which they are made
contains so large a quantity of mica (which the natives
do not understand how to get rid of), that it is very brittle,
and the imperfect baking in the open air contributes to
this brittleness. To compensate for the lack of handles by
which the vessels might be lifted, their whole outer surface
is made rather rough by being ornamented by a number
of triangles and zigzag lines, which form all manner of
concentric and spiral patterns. The gourd-platters and
bottles are generally decorated with different dark rows
of triangles. A large amount of labour is expended upon
the manufacture of clay bowls for pipes, which are often
really elaborate, and have generally quite a European
character; very often their design consists of a human
head, and these are so treasured as works of art, that
their possessors cannot be induced to part with them at
any price.</p>

<p>The preparation of skins for leather aprons and similar
purposes has hitherto been limited amongst the Bongo, as
probably amongst all the heathen negroes, to the simplest
mechanical process of kneading and fulling by means of
ashes and dung, which is followed up by a liberal application
of fat and oil till a sufficient degree of softness and
pliancy is attained. Recently from the Nubians the use of
tan has become generally known, and it may not unreasonably
be conjectured that the method of using it will gradually
extend from the north of Africa towards the south, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
same way as it has spread upwards from the Cape. Previous
to their contact with Europeans, none of the southern
people of Africa had discovered the use of tan, although
the skins of their animals were a very important item in
their economy. In Bongoland at present the bark of the
Gere (<i lang="la">Hymenocardia Heudelotii</i>) is what is most frequently
employed, and the red tan it yields is found to be very
effectual.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO PHYSIOGNOMY.</div>

<p>We have now to notice the apparel and general external
aspect of the people, which is as important in its way as the
outline of any natural object, such as the growth and foliage
of trees. In default of proper clothing, various disfigurements
of person play an important part, and the savage
is voluntarily even more of a slave to fashion than any of
the most refined children of civilization. Here, as in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
other quarter of the globe, the male sex desires to be
externally distinguished from the female, and they differ
widely in their habits in this respect. There is, however,
one ugly custom which is common to both sexes throughout
the basin of the Gazelle, which consists in snapping off the
incisors of the lower jaw, an operation which is performed
as soon as the milk teeth have been thoroughly replaced
by the permanent. Upon the south borders of the country,
near the Niam-niam, this custom ceases to be exactly followed,
and there it is the habit, as with the Niam-niam
themselves, instead of breaking them off, to file some of
the teeth, and indeed sometimes all of them, into sharp
points. Occasionally the natives file off the sides of the
upper teeth as well as clip off the lower; nor is it an
uncommon thing for gaps to be opened at the points of
contact of the central upper teeth, whilst every now and
then individual cases occur where interstices have been
made in the sides of all the four front teeth large enough
to admit a good-sized toothpick. Circumcision is unknown
throughout the entire river-district.</p>

<p>The men do not go about in a condition so naked as
either the Dyoor, the Shillooks, or the Dinka, but they
wear an apron of some sort of skin, and recently have
adopted a strip of stuff, which they fasten to the girdle
that is never missing, allowing the ends to hang over before
and behind. All the sons of the red soil, as the Bongo, the
Mittoo, the Niam-niam, and the Kredy, are called “women”
by the Dinka, because amongst them the females only are
protected by any covering of this description. The Bongo
women on the other hand, and especially those who reside
on the highlands, obstinately refuse to wear any covering
whatever either of skin or stuff, but merely replenish their
wardrobe every morning by a visit to the woods; they are,
therefore, in respect of modesty, less particular than the
women of the Dinka; a supple bough with plenty of leaves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
more often than not a bough of the Combretum, and perhaps
a bunch of fine grass, fastened to the girdle, is all they
consider necessary. Now and then a tail, like a black horsetail,
composed of the bast of the Sanseviera, is appended to
the back of the girdle in a way that has already been
mentioned. The rest of the body is allowed by both sexes
to be entirely unclad, and no addition to the costume is ever
seen, except we should reckon the feathered head-gear,
which is exhibited on the occasion of a feast or a ball.</p>

<p>As a rule the hair of both men and women is kept quite
short, and not unfrequently is very closely shorn, the principal
exception being found in the south, where the habits
of the Niam-niam have extended their influence into the
Bongo territory, and both men and women wear tufts and
braids of a length approximating to that of their neighbours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO WOMEN.</div>

<p>It may possibly be imagined that the extremely primitive
covering of the Bongo women
irradiates them with something
of the charm of Paradise;
but a very limited experience
will soon dispel the
rapture of any illusion of the
kind. All full-grown women
attain such an astounding
girth of body, and acquire
such a cumbrous superabundance
of flesh, that it is quite
impossible to look at them
without observing their disproportion
to the men. Their
thighs are very often as large
as a man’s chest, and their
measurement across the hips can hardly fail to recall the
picture in Cuvier’s Atlas of the now famous “Hottentot
Venus.” Shapes developed to this magnitude are no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
the exclusive privilege of the Hottentots; day after day I
saw them among the Bongo, and they may well demand to
be technically described as “Steatopyga.” In certain attitudes,
as for instance when they are carrying their heavy
water-jars upon their heads, they seem to assume the
shape of an inverted S. To their singular appearance the
long switch tail of bast very much contributes, and altogether
the profile of a fat Bongo woman is not unlike that
of a dancing baboon. I can vouch for it that women who
weigh twenty stone are far from scarce.</p>

<p>Very few are the people of Central Africa amongst whom
the partiality for finery and ornaments is so strongly shown
as with the Bongo. The women wear on their necks an
accumulation of cords and beads, and not being fastidious
like their neighbours, will put on without regard to shape or
colour, whatever the market of Khartoom can provide. The
men do not care much for this particular decoration, but
prefer necklaces, on which they string some of those remarkable
little fragments of wood which are so constantly found in
every region of Africa. With the bits of wood hang fragments
of roots, which are in form something like the mandrake, which,
in Southern Europe, has been the subject of so strange a superstition.
Alternating with the roots and wood are the talons
of owls and eagles, the teeth of dogs, crocodiles, and jackals,
little tortoise-shells, the claws of the earth-pig (<i lang="la">Orycteropus</i>),
and in short any of those objects which we are accustomed
to store in the cabinets which adorn our <i lang="fr">salons</i>. They appear
to supply the place of the extracts from the Koran which,
wrapped in leather sheathes, the Nubians wear by dozens
about their person; anything in the shape of an amulet being
eagerly craved by every African.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO DECORATION.</div>

<p>Not unfrequently the men deck themselves out in females’
ornaments. Many cover the rims of their ears with copper
rings and crescents; others pierce the upper lip like the
women, and insert either a round-headed copper nail or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
copper plate, or, what is still more general, some rings or a
bit of straw. The skin of the stomach above the waist is
often pierced by the men, and the incision filled up with
a bit of wood, or occasionally by a good-sized peg. On the
wrist and upper part of the arm they wear iron rings of every
pattern; some rings are cut out of elephant and buffalo hide,
and look almost as though they were made of horn. The
“dangabor,” an ornament composed of a series of iron rings,
and worn on the lower portion of the arm, has been already
described.</p>

<p>The Bongo women delight in distinguishing themselves by
an adornment which to our notions is nothing less than a
hideous mutilation. As soon as a woman is married the
operation commences of extending her lower lip. This, at
first only slightly bored, is widened by inserting into the
orifice plugs of wood gradually increasing in size, until at
length the entire feature is enlarged to five or six times its
original proportions. The plugs are cylindrical in form, not
less than an inch thick, and are exactly like the pegs of
bone or wood worn by the women of Musgoo. By this means
the lower lip is extended horizontally till it projects far
beyond the upper, which is also bored and fitted with a copper
plate or nail, and now and then by a little ring, and sometimes
by a bit of straw about as thick as a lucifer-match.
Nor do they leave the nose intact: similar bits of straw are
inserted into the edges of the nostrils, and I have seen as
many as three of these on either side. A very favourite
ornament for the cartilage between the nostrils is a copper
ring, just like those that are placed in the noses of buffaloes
and other beasts of burden for the purpose of rendering them
more tractable. The greatest coquettes among the ladies
wear a clasp or cramp at the corners of the mouth, as though
they wanted to contract the orifice, and literally to put a
curb upon its capabilities. These subsidiary ornaments are
not however found at all universally among the women, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
it is rare to see them all at once upon a single individual:
the plug in the lower lip of the married women is alone a <i lang="la">sine
quâ non</i>, serving as it does for an artificial distinction of race.
According to the custom of the people, there need only be a
trifling projection of the skin so as to form a flap or a fold,
to be at once the excuse for boring a hole. The ears are perforated
more than any part, both the outer and the inner auricle
being profusely pierced; the tip of the ear alone is frequently
made to carry half-a-dozen little iron rings. There are
women in the country whose bodies are pierced in some way
or other in little short of a hundred different places.</p>

<p>The Bongo women limit their tattooing to the upper part
of the arm. Zigzag or parallel lines, or rows of dots, often
brought into relief by the production of proud flesh after the
operation has been accomplished, are the three forms which
in different combinations serve as marks of individual distinction.
The men tattoo themselves differently, and some
of them abstain from the operation altogether. At one time
the lines run across the breast and stomach to one side of the
body; at another they are limited to the top of the arm,
whilst it is not at all unusual for the neck and shoulder-blades
to be tattooed.</p>

<p>Besides the ornaments that I have mentioned, the toilet
of a Bongo lady is incomplete without the masses of iron and
copper rings which she is accustomed to wear on her wrists
and arms, and more especially on her ankles. These rings
clank like fetters as she walks, and even from a distance the
two sexes can be distinguished by the character of the sound
that accompanies their movements. That human patience
should ever for the sake of fashion submit to a still greater
martyrdom seems almost incredible, though hereafter we
shall have sufficient proof when we delineate the habits of
the Mittoo, the neighbours of the Bongo, that such is really
the case.</p>

<p>In Bongoland, as in all the northern parts of the territory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
that I visited, copper of late years has attained a monetary
value, and has become an accustomed medium of exchange.
Glass beads are annually deteriorating in estimation, and
have long ceased to be treasured up and buried in the earth
like jewels or precious stones, being now used only to gratify
female vanity. In former times, when the only intercourse
that the Bongo held with the Mohammedan world was by
occasional dealings with the Baggara Arabs, through the
intervention of the Dembo, a Shillook tribe connected with
the Dyoor, cowrie-shells were in great request, but these also
have long since fallen out of the category of objects of value.
Gold and silver are very rarely used as ornaments, even in
the Mohammedan parts of the Eastern Soudan; it is therefore
hardly a matter of surprise that to the Bongo, whose
soil is singularly uniform in its geological productions, they
should be all but unknown. The Bongo, moreover, have
but little value for brass, differing greatly in this respect
from their neighbours, the Dyoor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO WEAPONS.</div>

<p>Their weapons consist mainly of lances, bows and arrows,
shields being very rarely used, and even then being appropriated
from other neighbouring nations. Although the
greater part of the population is at present quite unaccustomed
to any warlike occupation, except when any of them
chance to be employed in the raids upon the Dinka or in the
Niam-niam campaigns, yet they still maintain a wonderful
dexterity in the use of the bow and arrow, and we shall have
occasion in another place to notice their performances in this
respect. The large size of their weapons is remarkable; I
saw many of their bows which were four feet in length, their
arrows are rarely under three feet long, and on this account
they are never made from the light reed-grass, but are cut
out of solid wood. The forms of the arrow-heads also have
a decided nationality stamped upon them. In the course
of time I was easily able to determine at a glance the tribe
to which any weapon belonged by certain characteristics, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
details of which would now engross more time and space
than are at our command. It may be mentioned that the
Bongo, like the negroes above Fesoglu, on the Upper Blue
Nile, imbue their arrows with the milky juice of one of the
Euphorbiæ. This species, of which I now for the first time
collected some specimens, has been erroneously represented
by Tremaux in the atlas of his travels<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> as <i lang="la">Euphorbia mamillaris</i>,
but it is in fact one of the many Cactus-euphorbiæ for
which the flora of Tropical Africa, and especially that of the
drier regions, is distinguished, and is entirely distinct from
the South African species. It is a branching, straggling
shrub, varying in height from five to eight feet, at one time
growing in large masses in the light woods, and then failing
altogether for the space of several days’ journey. Not only
the larger branches, nearly two inches thick, but also the
smaller boughs, are encrusted with a snowy white rind,
covered with thick spiny protuberances, which stand singly
under the eyes of the leaves. At the extremity of each
bough is a bunch of fleshy succulent leaves, shaped like
lances, and six inches in length. This species of Cactus-euphorbia
(<i lang="la">E. venefica</i>) is termed by the Bongo “bolloh,” in
contradistinction to “kakoh,” their name for the larger sort
(<i lang="la">E. candelabrum</i>), which is common in the country, but of
which the milky juice is far less dangerous than that of the
“bolloh,” for if this be applied in a fresh condition to the
skin, it results in a violent inflammation. It is, however, my
opinion that this juice, as it is used by the Bongo, being
spread in a hard mass over the barbs and heads of the arrows,
can do very little harm to the wounded, as when it is once
hard it is difficult to melt, and there cannot possibly be time
for it to commingle with the blood after a wound has been
made by an arrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO GAMES.</div>

<p>We may now turn our attention to the Bongo games,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
which are as original and primitive as their music. One of
these games, as forming excellent training for the chase,
deserves some especial notice. A number of men are provided
with pointed sticks made of hard wood, which they use
as lances. They form a large ring, and another man who
has a piece of soft wood attached to a long string, runs round
and round within the circle. The others then endeavour
with their pointed sticks to hit the mark whilst it is being
carried rapidly round. As soon as it is struck it falls to the
ground, and the successful marksman is greeted with a loud
cheer. Another game requires no less calmness and dexterity.
A piece of wood bent into a crescent has a short
string attached to the middle; this wood is then hurled by
the one end of it with such violence to the earth that it goes
spinning like a boomerang through the air. The players
stand face to face at a distance of about twenty feet apart,
and the game consists in catching the wood by the string, a
performance that requires no little skill, as there is considerable
danger of receiving a sharp knock. Both games might,
under some modifications, admit of being adopted into our
rural sports.</p>

<p>Turning now to the national manners, customs, and ideas,
I profess that they are subjects of which I must treat with
considerable reserve, since my residence as a stranger for two
years amongst these savages only gave me after all a very
superficial insight into the mysteries of their inner life.
Since, however, the accounts of eye-witnesses, who knew the
land in its primitive condition, seem to accord with and to
corroborate my own observations, as well as the information
I obtained from the Bongo themselves, I am in a position to
depose to some facts, of which I must leave the scientific
analysis to those who are seeking to cultivate the untried
soil of the psychology of nations.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, and among other nations with whom I became
acquainted, the number of a man’s wives was dependent on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
the extent of his possessions, but amongst the Bongo it
seemed to be limited to a maximum of three. Here, as in
other parts of Africa, a wife cannot be obtained for nothing,
even the very poorest must pay a purchase price to the
father of the bride in the form of a number of plates of iron;
unless a man could provide the premium, he could only get
an old woman for a wife. The usual price paid for a young
girl would be about ten plates of iron weighing two pounds
each, and twenty lance tips. Divorces, when necessary, are
regulated in the usual way, and the father is always compelled
to make a restitution of at least a portion of the
wedding-payment. If a man should send his wife back to
her father, she is at liberty to marry again, and with her
husband’s consent she may take her children with her; if,
however, her husband retains the children, her father is
bound to refund the entire wedding-gift that he received.
This would be the case although ten years might have
elapsed since the marriage. The barrenness of a woman is
always an excuse for a divorce. In cases of adultery, the
husband endeavours to kill the seducer, and the wife gets a
sound flogging. Whoever has been circumcised according
to the Mohammedan law, cannot hope to make a good match
in Bongoland.</p>

<p>A Bongo woman, as a rule, will seldom be found to have
less than five children: the usual number is six, and the
maximum twelve. In childbirth she is supported with her
arms on a horizontal beam, and is in that position delivered
of the child; the navel-cord is cut very long with a knife, and
always without a ligature. No festivities are observed on the
occasion of a birth. The infants are carried on the mothers’
backs, sewn up in a bag of goat’s-hide, like a water-bottle.
The children are kept at the breast until they have completed
their second year, weaning being never thought of until they
can be trusted to run about. In order to wean a child, the
mother’s breast is smeared with some acrid matter, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
bruised leaves of some of the <i lang="la">Capparidæ</i> are mixed with water
to a pulp, and have the effect of drying up the milk.</p>

<p>Among the Bongo and the neighbouring nations there is a
custom, manifestly originating in a national morality, that
forbids all children that are not at the breast to sleep in the
same hut with their parents; the Bongo in this respect putting
to shame many of those who would boast of their civilization.
The elder children have a hut appropriated to
themselves, but take their meals with the rest of the family.
In addition to this custom there is the universal rule, as with
ourselves, that no matrimonial alliance takes place until the
youths are about eighteen and the girls about fifteen years
of age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO EXEQUIES.</div>

<p>In the disposal of their dead, the customs of the Bongo
are very remarkable. Immediately after life is extinct, the
corpses are placed, like the Peruvian mummies, in what may
be described as a crouching posture, with the knees forced
up to the chin, and are then firmly bound round the head and
legs. When the body has been thus compressed into the
smallest possible compass, it is sewn into a sack made of
skins, and placed in a deep grave. A shaft is sunk perpendicularly
down for about four feet, and then a niche is hollowed
to the side, so that the sack containing the corpse
should not have to sustain any vertical pressure from the
earth which is thrown in to fill up the grave. This form of
interment is also prescribed in the law of Islam, which, in
this and many other cases, has probably followed an African
custom. The Bongo have a striking practice, for which,
perhaps, some reason may be assigned, of burying men with
the face turned to the north and women to the south. After
the grave is filled in, a heap of stones is piled over the spot
in a short cylindrical form, and this is supported by strong
stakes, which are driven into the soil all round. On the
middle of the pile is placed a pitcher, frequently the same
from which the deceased was accustomed to drink his water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
The graves are always close to the huts, their site being
marked by a number of long forked branches, carved, by way
of ornament, with numerous notches and incisions, and having
their points sharpened like horns. Of these votive stakes I
saw a number varying from one to five on each grave. The
typical meaning belonging to these sticks has long since
fallen into oblivion, and notwithstanding all my endeavours
to become acquainted with the Bongo, and to initiate myself
into their manners and customs, I could never discover
a satisfactory explanation. The sticks reminded me of the
old English finance-budgets in the time of William the Conqueror.
In answer to my inquiries, the Khartoomers merely
returned the same answer as they did to my predecessor,
Heuglin; they persisted in saying that every notch denoted
an enemy killed in battle by the deceased. The Bongo
themselves, however, repeatedly declared that such was by
no means the case, and quite repudiated the idea that they
should ever think of thus perpetuating the bloodthirstiness
of the dead. The neighbouring Mittoo and Madi adopt very
much the same method of sepulture. The memorial-urns
erected over the graves of the Musgoo remind the traveller
of those of the Bongo. Whenever a burial takes place, all
the neighbours are invited to attend, and are abundantly
entertained with merissa. The entire company takes part in
the formation of the grave, in the rearing of the memorial-urn,
and in the erection of the votive stakes. When the
ceremony is finished, they shoot at the stakes with arrows,
which they leave sticking in the wood. I often noticed
arrows that had been thus shot still adhering to the sticks.</p>

<p>The Bongo have not the remotest conception of immortality.
They have no more idea of the transmigration of
souls, or any doctrine of the kind, than they have of the
existence of an ocean. I have tried various ways and means
of solving the problem of their inner life, but always without
success. Although the belief in immortality may be indigenous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
to Africa, I should question whether the ancient
Egyptians did not in their religious development obey the
promptings of the Asiatic East. At any rate, those statements
are incorrect which would endeavour to explain the
dull resignation displayed by the victims of human sacrifice
in Dahomey by a theory of their belief in immortality. All
religion, in our sense of the word religion, is quite unknown
to the Bongo, and, beyond the term “loma,” which denotes
equally luck and ill-luck, they have nothing in their language
to signify any deity or spiritual being. “Loma” is likewise
the term that they use for the Supreme Being, whom they
hear invoked as “Allah” by their oppressors, and some of
them make use of the expression, “loma-gobo,” <i>i. e.</i>, the
superior, to denote the God of the “Turks.” The almost
incomprehensible prayers of the Mohammedans are called by
the Bongo “malah,” which has evidently some connection
with the word “Allah” that is generally repeated over and
over again in all the devotions of the Nubians.</p>

<p>If any one is ill, his illness is attributed to “Loma,” but in
the event of anybody losing a wager or a game, or returning
from a hunting adventure without game, or coming back
from war without booty, he is said to have had “no loma”
(loma nya), in the sense of having no luck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO SUPERSTITION.</div>

<p>Quite amazing is the fear which exists among the Bongo
about ghosts, whose abode is said to be in the shadowy darkness
of the woods. Spirits, devils, and witches have the
general appellation of “bitaboh;” wood-goblins being specially
called “ronga.” Comprehended under the same term
are all the bats (especially the <i lang="la">Megaderma frons</i>, which
flutters about from tree to tree in broad daylight), as likewise
are owls of every kind (<i lang="la">Strix leucotis</i> and <i lang="la">Strix capensis</i>
being here the chief); and besides these the Ndorr (<i lang="la">Galago
senegalensis</i>), a kind of pseudo-simia, with great red eyes and
erect ears, which drags out a gloomy existence in the cavities
of hollow trees. There are, too, prowling beasts of night, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
which they entertain the utmost dread, regarding them with
superstitious awe. To ward off the evil influences of these
spirits, the Bongo are acquainted with no other means except
the magical roots in which the professional sorcerers trade,
in a similar way as the Mohammedan priests of the Soudan
in their amulets and sentences from the Koran. Very
seldom are any attempts made to expel the spirits by the
means of exorcism, which is turned to great account by the
Dinka magicians. The institution of the “Cogyoor” is here
called “belomah,” but whenever it is necessary to have an
invocation over a sick patient, they more often than not send
for a professional wizard from the neighbouring Dinka.</p>

<p>Good spirits are quite unrecognised, and, according to the
general negro idea, no benefit can ever come from a spirit at
all. They affirm that the only thing they know about spirits
is that they do mischief, and certain it is that they have no
conception either of there being a Creator, or any kind and
ruling power above. They assert that there is no other
resource for obtaining communication with spirits, except by
means of certain roots, which may be of service likewise in
employing the powers of evil to inflict injury on others. To
their knowledge of this magic may be attributed much of
the influence which the native chiefs, independently of their
authorised rule, exercise over the mass of the people in their
districts. This may be witnessed among the Bary on the
Bahr-el-Gebel, and a hundred other tribes, who yield the
greatest deference to the controllers or captains of their
communities. The practice of fetching down rain is never
pretended to by the Bongo chiefs, and may be said to be
absolutely unknown; but probably this may rise from the
climate so rarely making it necessary to put their skill in this
respect to the test.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BELIEF IN WITCHES.</div>

<p>All the very old people of either sex, but especially the old
women, are exposed to the suspicion of allying themselves to
wicked spirits, for the purpose of effecting the injury and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
detriment of others. Old folks, so the Bongo maintain,
wander through the forest-glades at night, and have only to
secure the proper roots, and then they may apparently be
lying calmly in their huts, whilst in reality they are taking
counsel with the spirits of mischief how they can best bring
their neighbours to death and destruction. They dig for
roots, it is continually said, that they may have the means
of poisoning those around them. Whenever any case of
sudden death occurs, the aged people are held responsible,
and nothing, it is taken for granted, could be more certain
than that a robust man, except he were starved, would not
die. Woe to the old crones, then, in whose house the suspected
herbs and roots are found! though they be father or
mother, they have no chance of escape.</p>

<p>A genuine and downright belief in witches has long been
and still continues as deeply seated here as in any spot upon
the face of the earth, and nowhere are prosecutions more
continually being instituted against them. As matter of fact,
I can affirm that really aged folks among the Bongo are
comparatively scarce, and that the number of grey-headed
people is, by contrast, surprisingly large amongst the neighbouring
race of the Dyoor, who put no faith at all in any
witchcraft. The Nubians are not only open to superstitions
of their own, but confirm the Bongo in all of theirs. In the
Eastern Soudan, which is a Mohammedan country, the conversation
will constantly turn upon the “sáhara” (<i>i. e.</i>, the
witches), and no comparison is more frequent than that
which likens the old women to hyænas: in fact, many of the
people hold hard and fast to the conviction that the witches
are capable of going out at night, and taking up their
quarters inside the bodies of these detestable brutes, without
any one being aware of what is happening. It chanced,
during my stay in Gallabat, that I killed one out of a herd
of hyænas that was infesting the district; my fate, in consequence,
was to be loaded with reproaches on the part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
Sheikh, who informed me that his mother was a “hyæna-woman,”
and that I might, for all I could tell, have shot her.
After this I was not so surprised as might be expected when
Idrees, the governor of Ghattas’s Seriba, boasted in my presence
of his conflicts with witches, bragging that in one day
he had had half a dozen of them executed. An occasion
shortly afterwards arose, when Idrees was contemplating
putting two old women to death at the desire of some Bongo,
and the only scheme I could devise to make him desist from
his purpose, was by threatening him that, in the event of
the women being executed, I would poison his water-springs.</p>

<p>But, in this dread of witches, the whole superstition of the
Bongo culminates and exhausts itself; and we Europeans
may well ask what real right have we, with all our advancement
in knowledge, to presume to reproach them? We cannot
resist the impression that these poor Bongo are infinitely
more free from hundreds of superstitious fallacies than many
of those who boast of their civilization; much more so, for
instance, than the Mohammedans of the Soudan, where the
idlest of superstitions prevail in every household. Let
nature be free, and the germs of energy in man’s spirit will
develop themselves, without overstepping their proper
limits, in trustful dependence upon the presiding spirit which
controls all thought. That the spirit of man, moreover,
revolves in a circle, is demonstrated by the old man becoming
again a child. A philosopher might fairly speculate (in the
spirit of Bernardin de St. Pierre, when he advocated a worship
of Nature) whether this land would not have been happier if
the Moslems had never set foot upon its soil. They brought
a religion that was destitute of morality; they introduced
contagion rather than knowledge; they even suppressed the
true doctrines of Mohammed their prophet, which would
have enfranchised the very people whom they oppressed,
and have raised them to a condition of brotherhood, and of
equality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO SURGERY.</div>

<p>The method of proceeding among the Bongo with the sick
and wounded is invariably of the very simplest character.
When the disorder is internal, and the origin cannot be
detected, the treatment consists merely in liberal applications
of very hot water. The patient is stretched upon the
ground, and sprinkled by means of leafy boughs with boiling
water from vessels that are placed close by. Somewhat
more expert is their proceeding in the case of the wounded.
It once chanced that I saw a group of sufferers brought back
from one of the raids that had been made into the territory
of the Dinka. The wounds had nearly all been inflicted by
the lances of the adversary. With remarkable fortitude the
patients all submitted to the practice of the country, which
consisted in the introduction of a number of setons, made of
the strong and fibrous bast of the grewia, into the injured
parts, in order to reduce the inflammation. Amongst others,
I saw a knee, which was immensely swollen, subject to the
operation of being pierced in every direction by setons of
this sort, until it was larded like a roast hare. With the
exception of red ochre the Bongo, like most of their neighbours,
are not acquainted with any mineral which they can
apply to a wound, either as a reduceut or an antiseptic. As
medicines to accelerate the natural processes of cure, they
make use of the astringent bitter barks of certain trees like
the Hymenocardia, the Butyrospermum, and the Prosopis,
which are here known as the “gere,” the “kor,” and the
“göll.” Syphilis, which now makes its insidious progress,
was quite unknown amongst these poor savages previous to
the settlement amongst them of the Nubians, and against its
mischief the only specific employed is the bitter bark of the
Heddo-tree (<i lang="la">Anogeissus</i>), one, however, which undoubtedly is
utterly useless for the purpose.</p>

<p>The misshapen and crippled are entirely unknown amongst
these unsophisticated children of Nature. But in a country
where, even with the best attention on the part of a mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
every child must be exposed to the perils which necessarily
are associated with existence in a wilderness, how should it
be possible for a cripple to stand out the battle of life? As
freaks of nature, every now and then there may be seen some
dwarfs, and I presume that some mutes may occasionally be
found, as there is a word (“mabang”) in their language to
express the defect in the faculty of speech.</p>

<p>The insane (“bindahko”) are shackled hand and foot; and
avowedly with the design of cooling and soothing their
passions, they are thrown into the river, where they are
immersed by practised swimmers. If this remedy should
prove of no effect, the patient is put into confinement, and
dieted by the relatives; but generally the lot of a maniac is
far happier than that which befalls an aged man, however
innocent. To maintain the strength of invalids, certain
kinds of flesh are prescribed, and a particular value is attributed
to the flesh of the Gullukoo (<i lang="la">Tmetoceros abyssinicus</i>), a
kind of rhinoceros hornbill, which has a detestable flavour,
as odious as hemlock.</p>

<p>The dialect of the people throughout the whole country
exhibits very little diversity; the best evidence for this is
afforded by the perfect uniformity of expression in every
part of the land for all natural objects whatever; whilst even
in dealing with conceptions of an abstract character, there is
little fear of being misunderstood. The language altogether
has a harmonious ring, abounding in the vowel sounds of <em>a</em>
and <em>o</em>, as the name of the people indicates; it is very simple
in its grammatical structure, and at the same time it presents
a great variety of terms for all concrete subjects. The
vocabulary that I compiled contained nearly one thousand
distinct expressions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGO DIALECT.</div>

<p>The etymology of connected words and the analysis of
separate idioms afford considerable interest, and transport
the student right into the ingenuous world of their natural
life. The more common of our abstract ideas such as <em>spirit</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
<em>soul</em>, <em>hope</em>, and <em>fear</em>, appear to be absolutely wanting, but
experience shows that in this respect other negro tongues are
not more richly provided by nature. The labours of missionaries
in translating the Scriptures have notoriously introduced
into the written language a number of elevated
idioms and of metaphorical ideas which very probably in a
few generations may be more or less incorporated into the
tongue, but to the student of language who shall make the
gleanings these introductions will be a mere refuse, and the
only subject of any scientific interest will be the speech of
the people as it was while it remained intact and unaffected
by innovation.</p>

<p>Instances of the indirect method which is employed on the
part of the Bongo to express any abstract idea may here be
given. The monosyllable “firr,” for example used in combination
with other words, answers the purpose of expressing
any of the following ideas: will, love, pleasure, taste, or
speech. The true conception which would appear to be the
original force of the little word, is first the will, and then the
expression of that will by means of the tongue. The phrase
for “I wish it,” would be “firr nahamah,” which is literally,
“The will is in my stomach.”</p>

<p>Nor is it uninteresting to notice the various equivalents
which are found of one and the same word. “Mahee” means
“lance” and “meat” in general, and is a collective expression
for antelopes of every kind; “attamatta” is employed
equally for what is “bitter” and what is “annoying;” “dill”
implies either a “shadow” or a “cloud;” “gimah” is used
indifferently for either “a son” or “a boy,” and “goah” for
either “a pit” or “deep.” “Helleleh” simply means
“wind” or “air,” but by reduplication “helleleh-helleleh,”
implies whatever is “light.” Either “rain” or “the sky”
may be indicated by the word “hetorro,” and “ndan” not
merely signifies “night,” but is used for “to-day.” This last
mode of expression has been transferred from the African to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
the Arabic of the Eastern Soudan, where “fee lehle” means
either “by night” or “this very day.”</p>

<p>The disposition which is ever manifested amongst the
untutored children of nature to represent certain animals by
imitating the sounds they utter, is extended amongst the
Bongo to describe a variety of inanimate object. As
examples of this kind of nomenclature I may mention
“golongolo” as their name for a “bell,” “gohi” as their name
for a “cough,” “kulluluh” for a “ball,” and “marongonn”
for “snoring.” The name they give a “cat” is “mbriow”
differing little in its pronunciation from “mew.”</p>

<p>There is a kind of poetry which underlies many of their
expressions, and which invests some objects with a certain
charm of indefiniteness; thus for example they call a leaf
“mbillee-kaggah,” “an ear of the tree,” and a man’s chest
they name “doah kiddi,” or “the capital of the veins.”</p>

<p>The speech of a people is very often indicative of the
predominating character of their pursuits. By the name of
“mony,” which originally meant the common sorghum, which
is the staple of their produce, the Bongo, being an agricultural
people, have come to denote not so much the particular
corn, as eatables of any description. They have,
moreover, adopted this word as the root of a verb which is
conjugated. In a way corresponding to this the Niam-niam,
who are mainly addicted to hunting, give a very comprehensive
meaning to their word “push-yo,” which signifies “meat.”
Of almost infinite variety are the names of the different
individuals among the Bongo. I had opportunities of making
inquiries whilst I was measuring nearly a hundred of the
people, and I do not think that I found more than five names
that occurred more than once. As a regular rule parents
name their children after trees or animals, or some object in
nature, and it is quite exceptional for any personal peculiarity
to be associated with the appellation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTERMINGLING OF RACES.</div>

<p>In the labyrinth of African culture it is very difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
disentangle the hundred threads which lead up to the centre
from which they have been all unwound. Not a custom, not
a superstition is found in one part which is not more or less
accurately repeated in another; not one contrivance of
design, not one weapon of war exists of which it can be
declared that it is exclusive property of any one race. From
north to south, and from sea to sea, in some form or other
every invention is sure to be repeated; it is “the thing that
has been.” The creative hand of Nature alone produces what
is new. If we could at once grasp and set before our minds
facts that are known (whether as regards language, race,
culture, history, or development) of that vast region of the
world which is comprehended in the name of Africa, we
should have before us the witness of an intermingling of
races which is beyond all precedent. And yet, bewildering
as the prospect would appear, it remains a fact not to be
gainsaid, that it is impossible for any one to survey the
country as a whole without perceiving that high above the
multitude of individual differences there is throned a principle
of unity which embraces well nigh all the population.</p>

<p>Such a conclusion has been amply borne out by the preceding
delineation of the Bongo, who form an element in
that unity. We cannot take a retrospect of the particulars
which have been now detailed about them, without the
question arising as to which of the other races of Central
Africa most nearly resemble the Bongo. Any answer to
this question that could not be invalidated would afford
hints invaluable for the investigation of the latest movements
among African nations; but I must confess that I am only
hazarding an opinion which I cannot establish, when I name
the countries about Lake Tsad as being those in which the
most marked similarity in habit to the Bongo might be
expected, and the tribes to which I would more particularly
allude are the Musgoo, the Massa, the Wandala, and the
Loggon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>I conclude by repeating the comparison which I made at
the beginning between the existence of a people and a drop
of water evaporating in the sea. Ere long, the Bongo as a
people will be quite forgotten, superseded by a rising race.
The time cannot be far off when this race, so gifted and so
impressionable, shall be known no more. The domination
over the people which is contemplated in Egypt cannot fail
to effect this result, and it is a destiny that probably awaits
all the rest of the African races. However much the Nubian
may tyrannize, he still leaves the poor natives a portion of
their happiness. But there is still a more distant future:
after the Nubian comes the Turk, and he takes all. Truly
it is not without reason that the proverb circulates in every
district, “Where the Turk has been no grass will grow.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">So</span> satisfactory was the condition of my health that it appeared
to me entirely to confute the opinion entertained by
Europeans that a prolonged residence in the tropics is destructive
alike of physical and moral energy. For those
probably who live in indolent repose, and who are surrounded
by all the appliances of domestic comfort, who, so far from
undertaking the trouble of a journey, have scarcely the
activity to take a walk, there may be some ground for the
presumption; and more particularly may this be the case in
Mohammedan countries where slothfulness and <i lang="fr">laissez faire</i>
are as contagious as gaping is all the world over. But
nothing of the kind is to be found for a traveller whose
elasticity is kept at all on the stretch, and who is conscious
of not having a minute to spare; the exercise of his faculties
will keep them in vigour as full as though he were still on
his native soil. For my own part, I could not help thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
of the contrast between the rainy season which I spent here
and that which, in 1865, I had passed in Gallabat; now all
was animated and cheerful; life seemed free from care; my
health was unimpaired, and I enjoyed the most intimate
converse with Nature; but then, on the contrary, it had
been a perpetual struggle between getting well and getting
ill, and I had never ceased to be haunted by the depressing
influences of a weary spirit.</p>

<p>However happily my time in the Seriba glided on, still it
was not altogether free from peril. An incident full of alarm
occurred to me on the night of the 22nd of May. The rain
was coming down in torrents, and about two hours after
midnight a tremendous storm ensued. The thunderclaps
rattling through the woods sounded like an avalanche, and
coming rapidly one upon another, seemed to keep pace with
the lightning which gleamed through the darkness of the
night. Suddenly there was a shrieking of women’s voices,
and at the same instant the blackness of night was changed
to the light of day, as the blaze of a burning hut flared up
aloft. The flaming structure was only separated from my
own quarters by my single granary. Aroused by the outcry
I sprang up; for to be caught asleep in an edifice constructed
of straw and bamboo is to be enveloped in fire, and is almost
certain death. The hazard was very imminent; in a very few
minutes my hut must apparently be in flames; the work of
demolition began at once; my powder was conveyed without
delay to a place of safety; my chests and my herbarium
were then secured; all the smaller articles of my furniture
were thrown into great waterproof coverings and dragged
out <i lang="fr">en masse</i>. Perhaps about half of my property had thus
been placed out of jeopardy when we observed that the wind
bore the flames in a different direction, and fortunately the
light framework of the burning roof gave way and it soon
fell in; saturated as the straw was with the rain it put a
check to the further spreading of the flames. Now was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
time to draw our breath and look around; we could now
give over our hurry and scurry, and examine the real condition
of things. I stood almost petrified at the reflection
how narrowly I had escaped coming to utter grief on this
unlucky night; I thought how deplorable had been my lot
if I had been reduced to a condition of nakedness and want
in this inhospitable land; I became alive to the sense of
shame with which I should have retraced my way back to
Khartoom within a year, and with my task unfinished; I
was dispirited; I knew not what might happen, and perhaps
this fire was only a prelude to yet more bitter experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KILLED BY LIGHTNING.</div>

<p>The tokkul which had been burnt down was hardly five-and-twenty
paces from my very bed. There, struck by
lightning, six female slaves had met their simultaneous
death; a seventh had been untouched by the electric fluid,
and had contrived, half dead from burning, to effect an
escape from the flaming pile. When a clearance was made
on the next morning, after the ashes had been removed, the
bodies of the ill-fated women were found completely charred,
lying closely packed together just as they had gone to sleep
in the hut around its centre support, which had been the
conductor of the lightning. They formed a ghastly spectacle,
at which even the native negroes could not suppress a
shudder, whilst the recently imported Niam-niam slaves
made no disguise of the relish with which they scented the
odour of the burnt flesh, as they helped to clear away the
<i lang="fr">débris</i>. Scarcely any incident could befall a traveller more
disquieting than this; it had haunted me in my dreams all
through my sojourn in the Soudan; forebodings of it had
stuck to my fancy, and now it appeared to be well-nigh on
the very point of literal fulfilment.</p>

<p>One of the Nubian soldiers had, amongst the six victims
of the conflagration, to bewail the loss of his sweetheart. To
such a degree did this bereavement prey upon him that he
entirely lost his reason, and so gave a considerable amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
trouble to the occupants of the Seriba. An instance of
affection like this never came to my knowledge elsewhere in
these districts.</p>

<p>As far as regards danger from fire, the settlement here
was at a disadvantage when compared with various Seribas
in which the huts are not crowded so closely together; but
in other respects, such as the more complete security of the
territory itself, the abundance of provisions, the rareness of
mosquitoes, and the small number of white ants, this Seriba
had recommendations which put every other in the shade.
Very advantageous was the appearance at my door, morning
after morning, of the neighbouring Dinka, who brought every
variety of their productions for me to purchase. In this way
I was kept amply provided not only with yams and earthnuts,
the purest of oil and the finest of honey, but I was able
readily to obtain all the corn I required for my retinue.
Moreover, it happened not unfrequently that I had some
natural production offered me of considerable rarity, and
thus the edge of my botanical curiosity was kept continually
sharpened. In the very depth of the rainy season by getting
the eggs of some geese and bustards, and even of some
ostriches, I managed to counterbalance the meagre produce
of my poultry-breeding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPEKE AND BAKER’S TRAVELS.</div>

<p>Of these opportunities of seeing considerable numbers of
the natives gathered round me, I made the best use I could
to obtain the measurements of their bodies, an achievement
on which I had set my mind with some degree of pertinacity.
At the end of one year’s residence in the interior I had made
a synopsis (under about forty heads) of the measurements of
nearly two hundred individuals, but unfortunately very few
of my memoranda are now forthcoming. During my intercourse
with the natives I very often allowed what pictures I
had to be exhibited, in order to satisfy their repeated inquiries.
All they saw stirred up their unfeigned delight, and
continually prompted them to ask in astonishment why they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
had not learnt the same things from the “Turks,” and to
express their conviction that that must be a wonderful
country where tools and guns were made. The indolent
Nubians, too, would pay me visits most assiduously till I was
absolutely weary of them. They would often make their
appearance quite early and I could only disengage myself
from them by letting them have my books and pictures
about Africa to look through. The illustrations in ‘Le Tour
du Monde,’ in Speke’s ‘Travels,’ and in Baker’s ‘Hunting
Adventures,’ all alike furnished them with inexhaustible
material for question and answer. They shouted their approbation
aloud, and crowned their admiring estimate of any
picture by crying out “bazyatoo” (the very facsimile), again
and again. The name which Speke’s book acquired in the
Seriba was ‘The History of King Kamrasi,’ while they
called Baker’s work ‘The Book of the Elephant Hunter.’</p>

<p>In the beginning of September I was able to make a
despatch to the river of my treasures I had collected, and to
forward them by way of Khartoom to Europe. I had upwards
of forty packages, and to put them together and make
them secure was the business of a good many days. Particularly
laborious was it to sew them all upon skins, and
still more laborious, I do not doubt, to rip them up again
when they reached their destination; for during their transit
across the parching desert, the hides are not unfrequently so
dried up that they become as hard as tin. For the protection
of my packages and to prevent the botanical contents being
invaded by insects or gnawed by rats, I had no difficulty in
providing the caoutchouc substance of the Carpodinus, the
“Mono” of the Bongo. This I obtained in a fresh condition,
when it has the appearance of a well-set cream, and washed it
lightly over the linen or the paper like a varnish. Not an
insect found its way through this coating, and my packages
all arrived thoroughly uninjured in spite of their being a
twelvemonth on their way. Less adapted for the purpose I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
found both the milky sap of the fig and of the butter tree,
because it is not so uniform in its character and does not
admit of being spread so readily.</p>

<p>The produce of Ghattas’s Company was this year four
hundred loads, being somewhere about 220 cwt., which would
be worth in Khartoom nearly 4000<i>l.</i> In order to reach this
amount, certainly not less than three hundred elephants had
been destroyed, and probably considerably more.</p>

<p>Although the ants at this spot did not abound in the
wholesale way in which they did in many other Seribas, there
were nevertheless plenty of inconveniences in my quarters,
and like every other traveller I had to get accustomed to
them as soon as I could.</p>

<p>My want of space was a great difficulty. I was hardly at
all better off in the hut where I ordinarily lived than in an
old overcrowded lumber room. I had no cupboards and no
small chests, and consequently I was compelled to be ever
packing up and unpacking my thousand bits of property.
The framework, of my own construction, which reached up
into the circular roof did something to increase my accommodation,
and I hung bags upon it containing my clothes and
my linen, and a whole host of little things besides I stuck
into the straw thatch above. Under such circumstances,
no wonder that I had perpetual conflict with rats, crickets,
and cock-roaches, and that they were a constant source of
annoyance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOXIOUS VERMIN.</div>

<p>The only method which was really an effectual guarantee
for the protection of any articles from being gnawed to bits
was to hang them up; but whenever at nightfall I had any
packages which could not be suspended there was one device
of which I made use, and which was tolerably successful in
keeping rats at a distance. One of the commonest animals
hereabouts was the wild cat of the steppes (<i lang="la">Felis maniculata</i>).
Although the natives do not breed them as domestic
animals, yet they catch them separately when they are quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
young and find no difficulty in reconciling them to a life about
their huts and enclosures, where they grow up and wage their
natural warfare against the rats. I procured several of these
cats, which, after they had been kept tied up for several days,
seemed to lose a considerable measure of their ferocity and to
adapt themselves to an indoor existence so as to approach in
many ways to the habits of the common cat. By night I
attached them to my parcels, which were otherwise in
jeopardy, and by this means I could go to bed without
further fear of any depredations from the rats.</p>

<p>Quite helpless, however, did I appear with regard to the
devastations of the crickets, which found their way through
my stoutest chests, ate holes into all my bags, and actually
fretted my very wearing-apparel and body-linen. Subsequently
I received a supply of borax, and this turned out to
be an adequate security against their mischief.</p>

<p>The encroachment of the wood-worms in the bamboos
which composed my hut developed itself into a nuisance of a
fresh sort. To myself it was a matter of great indifference
whether the building collapsed sooner or later, but just at
present it was a great annoyance to me that all day long
there should be an unceasing shower of fine yellow dust,
which accumulated on everything till it lay as thick as my
finger, and almost exceeded the bounds of endurance.</p>

<p>Another noxious insect which was to be found in every
hut was the Pillen-wasp (<i lang="la">Eumenes tinctor</i>). This was nearly
two inches long, and had a habit of forming its nest in the
straw right at the top of the circular roof. Associated with
eight or ten others it made a huge cell, and flying in and out
through the narrow doorway, which was the only avenue for
light, it came into constant collision with my face. Its
sting was attended by distracting agony far worse than the
sting of any bee. Throughout the entire year I was baffled
by these wasps, which were beautiful in colour, having wings
of a fine violet blue. I made many attempts to destroy their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
ingeniously-constructed nest, and only succeeded after catching
them in a butterfly-net and killing them one by one.</p>

<p>Throughout the tropics the harmless kinds of lizards may
invariably be reckoned amongst the settlers in every house.
Prettily marked skinks (<i lang="la">Euprepes quinquelineatus</i> and <i lang="la">E.
pleurostictus</i>) enlivened my abode, whilst the graceful gecko
(<i lang="la">Hemidactylus verrucalutus</i>) clambered up and down the
walls just as frequently as in Egypt and in Nubia. But
more numerous than all were the sociable agamæ (<i lang="la">Agama
colonorum</i>), which kept nodding their heads, in a way that
was extremely irritating to the Mohammedans, who fancied
that it was the devil making fun of their prayers. I had
previously repeatedly seen this species of the lizard in the
overhanging rocky crags of the desert valleys on the Egyptian
coast of the Red Sea; but here it appeared to lodge
itself quite as freely in the huts as in the woods. The head
of the male is of an orange-colour, and is easily detected
from a considerable distance. Very ridiculous are their
movements when any one approaches a tree upon which they
are running up and down. They betake themselves to the
farther side of the stem, and keep stopping at intervals, peeping
out cunningly first from one branch and then from
another, their large eyes beaming with a most knowing
expression. Their favourite resort, however, in this district
was the old woodwork of the palisades, and there they
mustered in thousands.</p>

<p>I was very much surprised, at the beginning of the rainy
season, at the large number of chameleons which at intervals
clustered themselves upon the sprouting foliage. The
common African sort grows to a very unusual size, and I
saw several which could hardly be less than ten inches long.
Scarcely less abundant is the smaller and slimmer species
(<i lang="la">C. lævigatus</i>), which does not exhibit quite to the same
extent the changes of its colour. Rolling its eyes in a very
remarkable manner it answered the same purpose as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
agama, with its nodding head, of getting up a joke against
the Mohammedan fanatics. “What is a chameleon like?”
I used to ask them, and not over delighted were they when
they were told that the chameleon, with its one eye up and
the other eye down, was a faki looking up to God in heaven,
but at the same time keeping a sharp look-out upon the
dollars of earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALUE OF QUININE.</div>

<p>Thoroughly free, as I have said, from fever, during March
and April, I persevered in taking my daily dose of ten
grains or more of quinine; but as the heat diminished, and
as the rainy season at its height was not so full of miasma,
I gradually diminished, and in June and July entirely gave
up my uniform administration of the tonic. But quinine
still remained my sole medicine, my only resort in every
contingency. If ever I got a chill, if ever I was wet
through, or was troubled with any symptoms of indigestion,
I lost no time in using it, knowing that for any traveller
in a region such as this, any indisposition whatever is simply
a doorway through which fever insidiously creeps and effects
its dangerous lodgment. Any sudden giddiness in the head,
or any spasm between the shoulders, or any failure in the
functions of the limbs were all, I do not doubt, warnings of
the ill-omened visitor, which I accepted in time to avert. Not
only, as I have remarked, were fevers here quite common, but
my own attendant, who had accompanied me from Alexandria,
was prostrated some days by a very serious attack, and
his condition of health was so much impaired that he had
to be sent back on the next return of the boats. There were
others, too, of my own people who had to endure attacks of
less severity.</p>

<p>Expecting, as I had been, a much larger fall of rain, I
could not be otherwise than much surprised at the meteorological
facts which were actually exhibited. Although the
rainfall extends over a longer period, the total average fall
of water is less here than it is either in Gallabat or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
Upper Sennaar, where the rain lasts only from the beginning
of May to the beginning of October. There the rain, almost
without exception, fell every night, and all night from sunset
till daybreak; but here it was the result of experience that
the rain ordinarily was to be expected between noon and
night. All travelling consequently has to be accomplished
before midday, and the journeyings are necessarily shorter
than in the dry winter months. It may be taken as a rule
that holds good very generally throughout the tropics that
if the sun rises clear or becomes clear shortly after rising,
there will pretty certainly be no rain for some four or five
hours. In Gallabat it was considered rather a feat to walk
during the rainy season from one house to another either
in slippers or in Turkish shoes, but here, day after day, such
protection for the soles of the feet was quite sufficient, even
where the ground was not at all rocky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLIMATE AND TEMPERATURE.</div>

<p>European vegetables in Gallabat had generally been
found to suffer from the excessive wet, and others had
either run into weeds or in some way degenerated, but here,
from May till August, we cultivated many sorts successfully,
and made good use of the intervals which, sometimes for
four or six days together, passed without any rain whatever.
To confirm what I have said, I adduce the facts that in
March 1869, in the centre of Bongoland (lat. 7° 20´ N.), the
“Khareef” was opened by four little showers; in April there
were seven considerable pourings; in May seven falls of
rain, lasting several hours; in June ten, in July eleven, and
in August twelve. These must not be reckoned as days of
rain, for the truth is, an entire day of uninterrupted rain
never once occurred. The rainfall only up to June was
attended by tempests or thunderstorms, after which date
the violence of them gradually and almost entirely abated.
Heuglin in 1863 had made the same observation. At the
end of July there ensued an entire change of temperature,
and only in exceptionally hot afternoons did the heat ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
again reach the extreme point which it had done previously;
but even at its maximum it had never exceeded 95° Fahr.
in the huts, whilst in the open air it was ordinarily 2° lower.
I could now rejoice in a degree of heat scarcely above what
is common in our northern zone, and seldom registered a
temperature above 77° Fahr. in my own quarters. This
fall in the thermometer is very beneficial and refreshing
to the European, whose skin, exhausted by repeated perspiration,
is very often distressed by a perpetual nettlerash.</p>

<p>The earliest rain which I observed this year fell while I
was still at the Meshera on the 2nd of March; and the
16th of that month was the date on which the wind altered
its course, and for the first time deviated from its long-prevailing
north-easterly direction.</p>

<p>The uniformity of climate in equatorial Africa contributes
very much to extend the range of particular species of
plants. To this may be added the absence of those mountain
systems which elsewhere, as in Asia, traverse the continent
in all directions. Without let or hindrance the
trade-winds exert their influence over the entire breadth
of this region. Any interruption of the rainy season between
the two zenith positions of the sun, which in Bongoland
are some months apart, has never been authenticated.
Although upon the north-west terraces of Abyssinia the
rainy season might appear, through the influence of the
mountains, to be obliterated or obscure, yet it could always
be traced; but nevertheless the whole aggregate of circumstances
which contribute to these precedents is not to be
estimated during the transitory observations of one short
sojourn.</p>

<p>Neither during the continuation of my wanderings towards
the south did I find any indication which seemed to evidence
that two rainy seasons had anywhere coalesced so as to
become one continuous period of rain, which sufficed throughout
the year to maintain an uninterrupted renewal of vegetation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
Nowhere in the equatorial districts which I visited
(not even in the territory of the Monbuttoo, of which the latitude
is between 3° and 4° N.) did it appear that there ever
failed a uniform period for foliage to develop itself. Apparent
exceptions might be found where the condition of the soil
is never otherwise than wet throughout the year; but even
in this low latitude there is a dry season and a wet season,
just as decided as in Nubia, twelve degrees further to the
north.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<div class="sidenote">SOLAR PHENOMENON.</div>

<p>Between five and six o’clock on the afternoon of the 18th
of May, while I was absorbed in my writing, I was suddenly
startled by the outcry of a number of my people calling me
to make haste out and witness the singular appearance which
was arresting their attention on the south-west horizon.
Great masses of clouds were covering the declining sun,
whilst all below the heavy cumulus the heavens gleamed
with the golden shimmer of a glorious sunset. Like a pile
from the mighty Alps, stern and imposing, surrounded by
dazzling glaciers and by many an avalanche, the central
clouds of this great gathering massed themselves in ponderous
layers which rolled majestically to the north. Starting
out abruptly from the brilliant glare of the setting sun, these
layers on their upper edge distinctly assumed the form of
three vast swellings, while around the margin of each of
these there gleamed the light of an unearthly glory; colours
of the richest hue combined to give an effect as though
each of the projecting accumulations were circled by a
rainbow. Midway between the vanishing violet of the bow
and the sombre ridge of cloud streamed a flood of light
which repeated itself upon the superior margin of the
wondrous spectrum. In three directions (issuing not directly
as from the sun in the centre of the mass, but
as though two parhelia besides contributed their power)
there rose separately from each of the three tumescent
rolls of cloud shadowy beams of light embracing the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
firmament above, whilst in addition to all this, there were
secondary groups of beams diverging from the angles where
the rainbow arches intersected. An appearance somewhat
similar to these shadowed rays or streaks of alternate light and
shade, resulting from the unequal masses of the floating clouds,
has been recorded by Professor Tyndall as witnessed in Algiers.
The colour of the rainbows on their edge nearest to the
sun, and in consequence approximate to the clouds, was
so remarkable that it could not fail to excite my attention.
Altogether it was a spectacle not to be forgotten. The
rainbow-like phenomenon had not the appearance of being an
ordinary arch repeated thrice, but was one scallopped bow
composed of three distinct but successive limbs: it continued
for about five minutes, and allowed me ample time
to make a sketch of its striking features.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>During September I found an opportunity to make a
third excursion to the Tondy, and had the good fortune to
make some valuable additions to my botanical store, but
apart from this my days glided on without variety, and I
have no episodes of interest to relate.</p>

<p>Fastened down as I was for the present to one spot, I had
to limit my observations to its immediate neighbourhood,
and accordingly with considerable perseverance and at the
cost of some trouble, and, I may be permitted to add, of
a good deal of soap, I went on taking the measurements
of many of the natives, who I thought might render me
service. There were hundreds of bearers, and after diligently
reckoning them up and instituting comparisons based
on written estimates and on a variety of portraits, I was
able to satisfy myself as to the characteristic features of
their nationality which they exhibit. I moreover devoted
a considerable time to learn the dialects of the district, and
found that the facility with which the different slaves had
mastered Arabic in their intercourse with the Nubians was
of great assistance to me in my endeavours.</p>

<p>Now and then there would occur incidents that were
somewhat ludicrous. One day a visit from the superintendent
of a distant Seriba was announced, and Idrees was
all on the alert to give his colleague a fitting reception.
The arrival was expected of Ali, the Vokil of Biselli, under
whose guidance Miss Tinné had passed the most memorable
year of her life. In readiness for the entrance of Ali into
the Seriba, the whole armed force was drawn up in double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
line before the gate. Ali was not only Ali (“tall and
strong”) by name, but he was in fact a head taller than
any of his retinue. Full of state, with majestic mien, with
the turban of the believer upon his head and the splendid
hezam of Tarablus around his loins, he was just entering
the military avenue when the soldiers fired their salute. The
discharge was rendered, and they all mutually smothered
each other in smoke. But the echoes of the salute were
hardly silent, and wreaths of smoke still hovered in the air,
when all of a sudden the solemnity was interrupted by the
cry of “Russahs! russahs!” (bullets, bullets), and one of
the soldiers rushed from the ranks, dashed down his musket,
and seemed bereft of his senses. In truth, his <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> had
forgotten to remove the charge from his rusty old gun, and
the shots that had been designed for the geese in some
neighbouring marsh had terribly punished the legs of his
unfortunate comrade. The poor fellow applied to me for
assistance, but I could not help him otherwise than by
a kind word. I had not in my possession any instruments
to extract the shot, and so I did the best I could to pacify by
quoting mysterious texts, and by commending him to the
mercy of Allah.</p>

<p>Rarely did a week elapse without the repetition of some
such mischance as this. Perpetually in peril myself of
being shot, I was ever being called upon to exercise my
surgical skill either in bandaging fractures, or in extracting
balls great or small; but as most frequently the shots found
their way into the legs of the sufferers, in the legs most
frequently I allowed them to remain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRAYERS OF THE PRIESTS.</div>

<p>Although my fatigue by day made repose by night very
essential to me, my rest was sadly disturbed by the habits
of my people. Quite intolerable at times was the eternal
babbling of their prayers, which, beginning in the evening
hours, were wearily prolonged, and nothing could accustom
me to the clamour which they made. They seemed at times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
to drive me in my impatience well-nigh to distraction.
Some priests had arrived from Darfoor, who surpassed all
else in the clamour they raised. With a lot of gibberish
utterly incomprehensible, through their antiquated pronunciation,
to any of the Nubians, they proceeded to recite the
verses of the Koran with the grinding monotony of a mill.
My own people, however, devoted Mohammedans as they
were, on these occasions took my part, and warned off the
disturbers of my rest from the proximity of the hut. I
cannot tell whether they were not such enthusiastic believers,
or whether their animosity was excited by the bombastic
erudition of the Foorians, but they set to work in earnest,
and made a clearance as effectual as I had once seen
accomplished by the officers of the liberal-tyrannical government
of Muntass Bey in Suakin. That ruler, when I
had last been residing in his town, had had the unparalleled
audacity to send his Khavasses into the neighbouring
mosque, and to threaten to make a free use of the kurbatch
if the prayers at night were not promptly stopped. He
sent a message to the effect that if the priests wanted to
pray they need not shriek, for Allah could hear just as
well without the outcry. The daring of such an intrusion
had never been matched from the day of creation
onwards.</p>

<p>Idrees, the superintendent of the Seriba, had eleven sons
all nearly of the same age, a circumstance readily explained
by his plurality of wives. For these youths, whom the
children of other residents were allowed to join, he had instituted
something like a regular Jewish school, and no one who
has ever had the chance of witnessing the proceedings of such
an institution can forget the sensation they left upon his ears.
Four times in the course of the four-and-twenty hours, at
intervals of four hours apart, does the chorus of voices in these
Nubian schools break out in alternate humming, and buzzing,
and shouting, occasionally varied by the didactic hammering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
of the master, by the switch of his rod, and the consequent
screams of the youngsters, which were invariably followed by
a louder and livelier articulation. There is one school time
just before sunset and another very shortly after, so that
every attempt at repose is certain to be thwarted. However,
I could always endure this disturbance with much more
equanimity than the humbug of the prayers; for, however
erroneous, according to our ideas, might be the method of
instruction in school, yet its object at least was laudable.</p>

<p>Occasions there were when nightly orgies were all the
rage, and the idle pretext under which these were maintained
was that the plague of flies permitted no rest. The Nubians,
when they had made themselves tipsy with their detestable
merissa, had the habit of finding an outlet for their hilarity
in banging on the kettle-drums which hung at the entrance
of the Seriba. To me this abominable noise was a very thorn
in the flesh, and as the huge drums were very near my
quarters, and had broken my sleep often enough, I took the
liberty of sprinkling the parchment with a sufficient quantity
of muriatic acid, so that the next time they were drummed
they split across. Till some new kettle-drums were provided
I could slumber in peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN INCANTATION.</div>

<p>Another interruption to a quiet night occasionally arose
from the native wizards, who practised the mystery of casting
out devils. I told them that they must be very indifferent
charmers if they were unable to expel the devils by day as
well as by night; but they did not appear to see matters at
all in that light. One occasion there was in which, out of
pure compassion, I permitted the proceedings to go on,
although the noise was so extreme that it would never have
been tolerated in the daytime. The wife of the Dinka interpreter
in the Seriba had been long suffering under some
chronic disorder, and he had undertaken a long day’s journey
to fetch a very celebrated conjuror or “Cogyoor” to treat her
case. The incantation began in a strain which would try the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
very stoutest of nerves: the strength of the wizard’s lungs
was astounding, and could have won a wager against a steam-trumpet.
The virtue of the proceeding, however, centred
upon this, and ventriloquism was called in to assist in producing
a dialogue between himself and the devil which possessed
the patient. I say the “devil,” because the Biblical
expression has accustomed us to the phrase, but I disapprove
of the translation, and would rather say the
“demon.”</p>

<p>In the most penetrating tone, something like the cackling
of frightened hens, only a thousand times louder, the sorcerer
began the enchantment, which consisted of several acts. The
first act lasted two hours without intermission, and unless it
were heard it could never be imagined. I was assured that
this introduction was quite indispensable—&#8203;as a means of
intimidating the devil and compelling him to reply, it could
not by any means be omitted from the execution of the
charm. The dialogue which followed between the wizard
and the devil was carried on by the artifice of ventriloquism.
The wizard made all kinds of inquiries as to the devil’s name,
the period of his possession of the woman, his proceedings,
and his whereabouts, and then went on to ask about his
lineage, his kinsfolk, and acquaintances. When for an hour
or more the wizard had interrogated him till he had got all
the answers he wanted, he set to work to provide the real
remedy. Hurrying away into the wood, he got some root or
herb, which perchance in many cases contributes to a cure.
It all vividly reminded me of the clap-trap which advertisers
and quacks are accustomed to employ, and how it may
happen that they get hold of some simple and long-known
material, which, under some marvellous name, they impose
as a novelty upon the public. Puffing is part of their trade,
and without a good deal of noise their business will not thrive
in Europe any more than in Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOINING ABOO SAMMAT.</div>

<p>The rainy season in due time came to its end. For seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
months and a half I had now been quietly quartered in the
Seriba of Ghattas; but a change was now impending, as I
had resolved to quit my limited range and to attach my fortunes
to the care of Aboo Sammat, whom I have already
mentioned. Repeatedly he had invited me, at his own expense,
to visit with him the Niam-niam lands, and I had
determined to follow the advice of my people, who knew his
character, and to accept his offer. I discovered that he had
penetrated considerably further to the south than any other,
and that he had more than once crossed that problematic
stream of the Monbuttoo which was said to flow quite independently
of the Nile system towards the west. The prospect
of visiting the Niam-niam would be much more restricted if
I were to remain attached to the expeditions of Ghattas’s
Company, as they had hitherto been confined to those nearest
and most northerly districts of that country of which the first
knowledge in Europe had been circulated by Piaggia.</p>

<p>I could not be otherwise than aware of the questionableness
of giving up my safe quarters, and exchanging my security
for the uncertain issues of a wandering life in Central Africa,
but irresistible was the inducement to enlarge my acquaintance
with the country and to find a wider field for my
investigations. The season of the year was, moreover, quite
in favour of pushing farther on than I had previously contemplated.
Full of expectation, therefore, I turned my hopes
towards the south, in an eastern direction, towards that untraversed
region between the Tondy and the Rohl, which already
is just as truly subject to the Khartoomers as that in which
I had been sojourning.</p>

<p>In my immediate neighbourhood I had tolerably well exhausted
the treasures of the botanical world; after the rains
were over there was a comparative barrenness in the productions
of nature. I made, indeed, my daily excursions, but
they reached only to places which I had previously inspected.
A sense of irksomeness began to predominate, and every tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
of any magnitude, every ant-hill had become so familiar that
they had entirely lost the charm of novelty.</p>

<p>Aboo Sammat, in the most complimentary way, had made
me a variety of presents: by special messengers he had
conveyed to me animal and vegetable curiosities of many
sorts. He once sent me the munificent offering of a flock of
five-and-twenty sheep; and at my own desire, but at his cost,
he furnished me with a young interpreter to teach me the
dialect of the Niam-niam. In the middle of November, on
his return from the Meshera, he would take our Seriba on
his way, and I resolved to join him.</p>

<p>The people at Ghattas’s quarters endeavoured, but to no
purpose, to dissuade me; they represented in very melancholy
colours the misery to which I should inevitably be
exposed in the desert life of Aboo Sammat’s district, which
was every now and then threatened with starvation. There
would be no lack of monuments of antiquity (“antigaht,”
as they called them), or of hunting, or of wild beasts, but I
must be prepared for perpetual hunger. Against all this,
however true it might be, I consoled myself with the reflection
that Aboo Sammat would certainly manage to keep me
in food, and the difference of one more or less in number
could not be very serious.</p>

<p>Another important reason which weighed with me was the
saving of expense in the way of travelling. The mere cost
of bearers for a journey through the Niam-niam lands would
be some thousand dollars, which, according to contract, would
go into the pocket of Ghattas: this would entirely be avoided
if Aboo Sammat fulfilled his promise, and there was nothing
to induce me to suppose that he was otherwise than a man of
his word.</p>

<p>Nothing now seemed longer to detain me in the Dyoor or
Bongo countries: accordingly, resolved to make a start, I
packed up my goods without delay, and made the Governor
acquainted with my intention. A regular commotion followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
in the Seriba: the clerks and notaries produced the contract
which had been signed at Khartoom, and attempted not only
to demonstrate that Aboo Sammat had no right to receive
me, but that Ghattas had the sole responsibility of my weal
and woe, and must answer, at the peril of his head, for any
misfortune that might befall me while I was under the tutelage
of Aboo Sammat. The distorted character of their
logic was manifest as soon as the evidence was shown that
Ghattas was under obligations to me and not I to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PASSAGE OF THE TONDY.</div>

<p>After I had made all my arrangements to store the
collections which had accumulated since my last despatch, I
prepared to quit my bountiful quarters and to start by way
of Koolongo over the desolation of the wilderness towards the
south. The baggage which I found it necessary to take, I
limited to thirty-six packages. The Nubian servants, three
slaves, and the interpreter, composed my own retinue, but
Aboo Sammat’s entire caravan, counting bearers and soldiers,
consisted altogether of about 250 men. I myself joined the
main body at Kulongo, where preparations had just been
completed for the passage of the Tondy, which was then at
high flood.</p>

<p>The regular progress began on the 17th of November. A
march of an hour brought us to the low plain of the Tondy,
where four Bongo bearers were ready for me with a kind of
bedstead, on which I reclined at my ease as they conveyed
me upon their shoulders above the many places which were
marshy or choked with rushes, till they reached the ferry
that Aboo Sammat had arranged. This ferry consisted of a
great raft of straw upon which the packages were laid in
separate lots, and to which most of the bearers clung while
it was towed across by a number of swimmers who were
accustomed to the stream. The Nubians floundered like fish
in the strong current, and had some work to do in saving
many a “colli,” which, in the unsteadiness of the passage,
was thrown out of its equilibrium. The river, by its right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
bank, was running at the rate of 120 feet a minute and was
about 200 feet across. Nearly exhausted as I was by the
violence of the stream, when I approached the further side
I was grasped hand and foot by a number of the swimmers,
who brought me to land as if I had been a drowning man.</p>

<p>Beyond the river the land was less affected by any inundation,
and after a few minutes we came to a steep rocky
highland which bounded the way to the south. Rising to an
elevation of little more than 200 feet, we had a fine open
view of the depressed tract of land through which the Tondy
meanders. Its windings were marked by reedy banks; the
mid-day sun gleamed upon the mirror of various backwaters,
and the distance revealed a series of wooded undulations. Tn
a thin dark thread, the caravan wound itself at my feet along
the green landscape, as I have endeavoured to depict it in
the annexed illustration. The height on which we stood
was graced by a beautiful grove, where I observed a fresh
characteristic of the region, viz., the alder-like Vatica, a tree
of no great size, but which now appeared in detached clumps.
In the foreground of the picture are represented some of the
most charming types of vegetation in the bushwood; on the
left is the large-leaved blue-green <i lang="la">Anona senegalensis</i>; on
the right, the <i lang="la">Grewia mollis</i>, a shrub with long twigs that
supplies an abundance of bast and string wherever it grows.
The little tree of the pine genus is the willow-leaved Boscia,
which is a constant inhabitant of the Upper Nile district.</p>

<p>It was getting late in the day before we had assembled
our whole troop upon the plateau. Very short, consequently,
was our march before we halted for the night. The spot
selected for the purpose had formerly been a small Seriba
belonging to Ghattas; but in consequence of the Bongo who
had settled there having all deserted, and of the difficulty of
maintaining any intercourse with other Seribas during the
rainy season, it had been abandoned. It was a district of
utter desolation, far away from any other settlements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DOGGOROO RIVER.</div>

<p>A brook, which in July and August becomes swollen to a
considerable stream, flowed past our quarters for the night,
and joined the Tondy at the distance of a few leagues. To
this rivulet, which has its source in the Madi country, in
lat. 5° 10´ N., the Bongo give the name of the Doggoroo,
whilst it is known as the Lehssy in the districts which divide
the territories of the Bongo from the Niam-niam. Up the
stream we followed its course for two hours, keeping along
the edge of a pleasant park-like country, till we arrived at
some thickets, which we had to penetrate in order to reach
the banks of the stream. Sluggish here was the water’s
pace; its breadth was about thirty feet, and it was sufficiently
shallow to be waded through, scarcely rising above our hips;
on our return in the following year the passage involved us
in considerable difficulty. Beyond the Doggoroo the ground
made a gradual but decided rise, and for more than forty
miles the ascent was continuous. It was the first elevation
of the ground of any importance which I had yet seen anywhere
south of the Gazelle; for here was a broad offshoot of
the southern highlands, which, according to the statements
of the natives, serve as a watershed for the coalescing streams
of the Tondy and the Dyau (Roah).</p>

<p>After we had proceeded in a south-easterly direction till
we had accomplished about a third of our journey to Sabby,
the Seriba of Mohammed Aboo Sammat, we had at no great
distance the territory of the Dinka upon our left. The
adjacent clan is called the Goak, and a large number of the
Bongo have taken refuge amongst them to escape the aggressions
and stern oppression of the Nubians. The Dinka, for
their part, impressed the strange intruders with such awe
that, since Malzac (the well-known French adventurer, who
for several years took up his quarters on the Rohl), no one
has repeated the attempt to establish a settlement in their
district. It is simply their wealth in cattle that is a temptation
to occasional raids, which are studiously accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
as far as possible without bloodshed. On the last stage
between the Tondy and the Doggoroo we repeatedly came
across the traces of elephants; but the trenches which had
been designed to catch them had not as yet been a success.
Elephants seem to prefer to make their way along the narrow
paths which have been already trodden by the foot of
man through the high grass, notwithstanding that they are
not sufficiently broad to admit a quarter of their huge
bodies.</p>

<p>After the rains are over and the steppe-burning accomplished,
the landscape reminded me very much of the late
autumn-time of our own latitudes. Many trees were entirely
destitute of foliage; the ground beneath them being strewn
with yellow leaves or covered with pale sere grass as far as
the conflagration had spared it. One charming tree, a kind
of Humboldtia, was conspicuous amidst the shadowy groves.
It has seed-vessels a foot long, the seed itself being as large
as a dollar, whilst its magnificent leaf is a beautiful ornament
to the wood scenery wherever it abounds. The gay
colours of the young shoots, sprouting directly from the root,
crimson, purple, brown, or yellow, contribute in a large
degree to this effective display. The foliage generally is so
light that it was quite easy to penetrate into these woods,
which constantly and agreeably relieved the barren aspect of
the region.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WATERBOCK.</div>

<p>A considerable number of antelopes from various quarters
had been killed by the hour in which we encamped for the
night in a forest glade. These antelopes belonged to the
Waterbocks (<i lang="la">A. ellipsiprymna</i>), of which the head is very
remarkable, on account of the large excrescences which
obtrude from the side of the nostrils, in the same way as
in the wild buffalo. It has a fine sweeping pair of horns,
which crown its brow. The hair of this species of Waterbock
is extremely long and soft, and its skin is a very favourite
decoration of the Niam-niam. There is but little difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
in getting an aim at this animal, as its white haunches soon
betray it amid the gloom of the forest, where it is more frequently
found either quite solitary or in very small groups.
I very much relished the tender flesh of the kids, although
it was somewhat deficient in fat.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>When morning dawned the only remnant of our supper
was a pile of crushed bones; for neither skin nor gristle had
been spared by the greedy negroes. The beast of prey disdains
what a voracious man will devour; the beast rejects
what is tough, and gnaws only about the soft and supple
joints, whilst man in his gluttony roasts the very skin, splits
the bones, and swallows the marrow. Splintered bones, therefore,
here in the lines of traffic, just as they do in the caverns
of antiquity, afford a distinctive evidence of the existence of
men, whilst bones that have been gnawed only attest the
presence of lions, hyænas, jackals, and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>Few there are who have not read of the glory of the
southern heavens; rare is the traveller in the tropics who has
not revelled in the splendid aspect of the great arch above
when illumined by the shining of the moon. After a long
hot march it may indeed happen that the traveller is far too
weary and worn-out to be capable of appreciating the charm
of any such beauties; in passive indifference, stretched upon
his back, he turns a listless eye unconcerned upwards to the
sky, till sleep overpowers him; and thus unconsciously he
loses the highest of poetic ecstacies. Soon the heaven
bedecks itself with countless numbers of fleecy clouds, which
separate as flakes of melting ice, and stand apart: the deep
black firmament fills up the intervals, and gives a richer lustre
to the stars; then, circled by a rosy halo, rises the gentle
moon, and casts her silver beams upon the latest straggler.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, far in the lonely wood, there has arisen, as it
were, the tumult of a market; the gossip of the chatterers
is interrupted now and then by the authoritative word of
command of some superior officer, while many a camp-fire
is kindled and illuminates the distant scene. To protect
himself against the chilly air of night, each separate bearer
takes what pains he can, using what ashes he can get for his
covering. Wreaths of smoke hover over the encampment, a
sense of burning oppresses the eyes and makes sleep all but
impossible, and thus the attention is ever and again arrested
by the moving orbs in the heavens above. To the traveller
it well might seem as if the curtain of a theatre had been
raised, and revealed a picture of the infernal world where
hundreds of black devils were roasting at as many flames.
Such were my nightly experiences as often as I journeyed
with a large number of bearers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHEREEFEE.</div>

<p>About noon on the third day, after marching about sixteen
leagues from Kulongo, we arrived at Duggoo, the chief
Seriba of Shereefee, who maintained some small settlements
in this remote wilderness. Notwithstanding the almost unlimited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
scope with regard to space, he was on the bitterest
terms of hostility with Aboo Sammat, his neighbour in the
south. A regular mediæval feud had broken out between
them, the nominal cause of the quarrel being that one of
Shereefee’s female slaves had been maltreated, and, having
taken refuge with Aboo Sammat, had not been restored; but
the interchange of cuffs and blows had been the actual
ground of the discord. When two months previously Aboo
Sammat was despatching his ivory-produce of the year, consisting
of about 300 packages, to the Meshera, it was seized
by the negroes as it was being conveyed across Shereefee’s
district. These negroes attacked the defenceless bearers
and massacred several of them; others they wounded with
arrows and lances, till the whole caravan was overpowered,
and every one throwing down his valuable burden made a
precipitate flight. The Khartoom soldiers belonging to
Aboo Sammat looked quietly on throughout the fray, for no
attachment to their master would have induced them to fire
a shot against any of their brethren.</p>

<p>Aboo Sammat, with all his property, was now in the desert,
150 miles away from the boats. To enter into action against
Shereefee he hastened to the west, and induced a number of
the controllers of Seribas to repair to the scene of violence,
and to insist upon judgment being passed at Khartoom. But
to accomplish this purpose he had to travel hundreds of
miles in a few weeks, during the rains, and before his task
was completed the proper time for shipment had elapsed, the
high waters had abated, and all his goods had to remain at
the Meshera to await another season, exposed all along to the
too probable attacks of the hostile Dinka. Aboo Sammat,
so far from taking the law into his own hands, had proceeded
in the most legitimate way to demand compensation; but
Shereefee, not satisfied with the wrong he had already perpetrated,
spurred on his negroes to make repeated incursions
upon his rival’s territory. Sometimes he endeavoured to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
entice Aboo Sammat’s Bongo people to desert, and sometimes
sent his own to commit all manner of outrage and
depredation. Many of the poor natives, the shuttlecocks of
the fray, lost their lives in the contention; and I enriched
my collection of skulls by some splendid specimens which
I picked up on my way. “This was the spot,” said Aboo to
me, “where the thieves made their attack. You have seen
for yourself, and should speak up for me.”</p>

<p>Approaching the neighbourhood of the hostile Seriba we
made a halt in the open country, about half a league away.
To put a good face on the matter, and to make an impression
upon Shereefee’s people, everybody put on their best
clothes, and Aboo Sammat’s soldiers came out in all the gay
colours of the fresh chintz which had just been acquired from
the stores of the Meshera. The Turkish cut of these garments
contributed in no small degree to the self-confidence
of the men, and the Kenoosian could fairly pride himself
upon having a troop who, not merely in externals, but in
general discipline, were far superior to the disorderly bands
which, in dirty rags, were quartered at the other Seribas.
Every precaution was taken to guard against a sudden
attack, and patrols were sent out to protect the flanks of our
extended line. Ambushed in the thickets some armed Bongo
were actually seen, but these outlying sentinels as soon as
they observed there was a white man in the caravan, having
heard of my presence in the country, abstained from any
exhibition of hostility. Thus unmolested we drew close up
to the Seriba, and Mohammed’s party bivouacked out in the
open country. Meanwhile I was received in the most friendly
manner by Shereefee’s brother, who was here in charge, and
there was no disposition to act towards a Frank in any way
that might involve difficulty at Khartoom. But I could not
help thinking how narrowly all my baggage might be
escaping attack, and what a hopeless attempt it might be to
recover it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DUGGOO.</div>

<p>The whole district, as I have mentioned, had been gradually
rising in terraces all the way from the Tondy; and
only just before we reached the Seriba, which was named
Duggoo, after the superintendent of the place, had we
marched continuously up-hill for half a league; no flowing
water had hitherto been observed. On the south-west and
south-east were visible the highlands in the distance, whilst
in front of them were elevations of from 100 to 200 feet
above the level of the adjacent vale. One of these elevations
was very close to Duggoo in the north-east, whence from a
bamboo jungle there streamed in the rainy season a brook
which fell into the Dyan. The recesses and caverns in the
red iron-stone reminded me of the great grotto at Kulongo,
with its swarms of fluttering bats (<i lang="la">Phyllorhinus caffra</i>) and
vast accumulation of guano.</p>

<p>The wide stretch of country between the Tondy and the
Dyoor, extending some seventy miles, had but three years
since been a populous district with many huts; now, however,
it had only a few scattered habitations of the Bongo,
which were grouped in the vicinity of either Aboo Sammat’s
or Shereefee’s Seribas. Since the Bongo have been expelled
by the Dinka, nothing but elephants and antelopes have
found their pasture in those wild plains, which have once
been cultivated. Occasionally the ruins of the burnt villages
were still extant, rising above the rank grass. Nothing survived
as direct evidence of the habitation of men; what
scanty remnants of dwelling-places the first conflagration of
the steppes had spared, either the ants or natural decay had
soon destroyed. The only remaining vestiges of the occupation
of the land are due to the richness of vegetation, and
this has left its characteristic traces. I could specify some
fifty or sixty plants which correspond so accurately with the
weeds of other cultivated countries that they are significant
tokens of a former presence of men. The preponderating
Indian origin of all these plants is very observable, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
better acquaintance with the geographical facts connected
with them would probably be as trustworthy an indication of
the various migrations of an uncivilized people who have no
history as either their dialect or their physical development.</p>

<p>Five leagues away from Duggoo we arrived at Dogguddoo,
the second Seriba of Shereefee, where he was then resident.
Many a slough and many a marsh had we to traverse on our
progress, the result of the rain which had been falling for
months. Midway we paused for a rest beside the relics of a
great Bongo village, where stood the ruins of a large fence
of the same description as is seen around the present Seribas.
In the very centre of the village had stood, as is commonly
found, an exceedingly fine fig-tree (<i lang="la">F. lutea</i>), and there were
besides, a large number of tombs constructed of blocks of
stone and ornamented with strangely-carved posts; at some
little distance was a number of handmills that had been left
behind, destined for some years to come to be a memorial of
the past. The spot, named after the previous governor, was
called Pogao. Shortly afterwards we arrived at a charming
little brook, known as the Mattyoo, which, under the shadow
of a pleasant copse-wood, went babbling over its red rocky
bed, making little cascades and rapids as it streamed along.</p>

<p>In consequence of the repeated burnings of the steppes,
well-nigh all vegetation was now blighted and impoverished:
in particular the higher districts presented an appearance of
wretched desolation. Repeatedly, in the winter landscape
of the tropics, there are seen trees standing in full foliage in
the very midst of their dismantled neighbours; and the loss
of leaf would seem to be hardly so much an unconditional
consequence of the time of year as a collateral effect of
locality or condition of the soil.</p>

<p>After having for months together explored every thicket,
and day after day penetrated into the high grass on the
river-banks, I could not suppress my astonishmant at the
absence of every description of snakes. The Khartoomers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
suggest an explanation of this circumstance which I am not
disinclined to accept; they conjecture that in this stony
region there is a deficiency of that rich black soil which
splits like a glacier in the dry season, and makes riding in
the North-Eastern Soudan a very dangerous proceeding;
and, consequently, that there is neither a way for snakes
to escape from the fires of the blazing steppes, nor any
of those lurking-places which are indispensable for their
resort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STEPPE-BURNING.</div>

<p>Incalculable in its effect upon the vegetation of Central
Africa must be the influence of the annual steppe-burning,
which is favoured by the dryness of the seasons. The ordinary
soil becomes replaced by charcoal and ashes, which the rain,
when it returns, as well as the wind, sweeps right away into
the valleys. The rock is, for the most part, a very friable
and weather-worn ironstone, and upon this alone has everything
that grows to make good its footing. The distinction,
therefore, as might be imagined, is very marked between
vegetation under such conditions, and vegetation as it displays
itself by the banks of rivers, where the abundant grass
resists the progress of the fire, and where, moreover, a rich
mould is formed by the decay of withered leaves. But even
more than the impregnation of the soil with alkalies, does
the violence of flames act upon the configuration of plants in
general. Trees with immense stems, taking fire at the parts
where they are lifeless through age, will die entirely; and,
where the grass is exceptionally heavy, the fresh after-growth
will perish at the roots, or in other places will be either
crippled or stunted. Hence arises the want of those richly-foliaged
and erect-stemmed specimens which are the pride of
our own forests; hence the scarcity of trees, which are either
old or well developed; and hence, too, the abnormal irregularity
of form which is witnessed at the base of so many a
stem and at the projection of so many a shoot.</p>

<p>Flowing without intermission, all through the year, close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
by Dugguddoo, there is a brook which the Bongo have
named the Tomburoo. Its water hurries on at the rate of
170 feet per minute, its depth hardly ever exceeds three
feet, while its breadth varies from 20 feet to 50. Its banks,
about four feet high, were bounded by land subject to inundations
corresponding to the measurement of the stream. At
a league’s distance to the east, the general elevation of the
soil began afresh. The environs of the Seriba of Shereefee
were only scantily cultivated, as the Nubians and the Bongo
lived by preference on the produce of the plundering
forages which they were accustomed to make amongst the
adjacent Dinka tribes, the Ayell and the Faryahl, towards
the north.</p>

<p>Exposing itself far and wide, there was the naked rock,
the barrenness of which was only interrupted at intervals by
a scanty covering of human bones! Carried off in groups,
the captured slaves here succumbed to the overwrought
exertions of their march. At times they died literally of
starvation, as often there was no corn to be had in the
barren land. The overland dealers in slaves make their
purchases here at the most advantageous prices. In these
eastern Seribas, as the result of the perpetual raids upon the
Dinka, there is always a superabundance of the living black
merchandise on hand, but very rarely is there an adequate
supply of food for their maintenance. The traders proceed
from Seriba to Seriba with their gangs, which they maintain
on whatever provisions they can get on the way. Where
destitution is an ordinary phase of things, it is self-evident
that the traffickers, having no resources to support a lengthened
journey, must, day after day, suffer considerable loss,
and it is no unwonted thing for their gangs to melt away by
a dozen at a time. Burnt bones of men and charred palisades
of huts are too true an evidence of the halting-places
of Mohammedanism, and, day by day, more and more was
my imagination shocked by these horrid spectacles. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
the very Seriba there was even awaiting me afresh the
miserable sight, to which no force of habit could accustom
me, of a number of helpless children, perfect little pictures
of distress and wretchedness, either orphans or deserted by
their mothers, and who dragged on a pitiable existence,
half-starved, burnt by falling into the fire in their sleep, or
covered with loathsome sores.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAND-SNAILS.</div>

<p>Turning short off, almost at a right angle to our previous
direction, our way beyond Duggoroo, after seven leagues,
over a country well-wooded and rich in game, led us to the
borders of Aboo Sammat’s territory. Once again the land
began to rise, and appeared to be all but barren in water-courses
of any kind. As we went along I picked up, in a
state of perfect preservation, several of the bleached skulls
of some of Aboo Sammat’s bearers, who, wounded in the
murderous attack by Shereefee’s people, had never been able
to regain their homes. In a bag, which one of my attendants
constantly carried, I had a collection made of a number of
the great land-snails which, after the termination of the
rains, abounded in this region. The two kinds which
appeared most common were <i lang="la">Limnicolaria nilotica</i> and
<i lang="la">L. flammea</i>; of these, the former is rather more than four
inches in length, the latter rather more than three. They
invade the bushes and shrubs, and have a great partiality
for the tender leaves of the numerous varieties of wild vine.
They serve as food for a number of birds, the <i lang="la">Centropus
monachus</i>, the cuckoo of the climate, in particular having a
keen relish for them. Their shells are as thin as paper,
a circumstance which, like the brittleness in the egg-shells of
hens, testifies to the deficiency of chalk in the soil. I was in
need of soap, and the chief object which I had in taking the
trouble to collect these shells was to obtain what cretaceous
matter I could, to enable me to make a supply, no other
method of getting it occurring to my mind. At night we
rested at a poor Seriba called Matwoly, where we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
received in some dilapidated huts, as the place, together with
all its Bongo adjuncts, for greater security against the attacks
of Shereefee, was about to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The wearisome monotony of the woods, now generally
stripped of their foliage, was enlivened by the fresh green of
the Combretum, which here long anticipates every other tree
in putting forth its tender buds. Gaily it stands apart from
the uniform grey and brown of the surrounding forest,
thrown into yet higher relief by the yellow of the mass of
withered grass below, and showing itself brightly from the
half-shaded gloom of the wood beyond.</p>

<p>Although I had now advanced an entire degree nearer to
the Equator, being now in a latitude of 6° 20´ N., I still
found that the landscape around had charms to offer which
were not inferior to the winter beauties of the distant north.
In the early morning I delighted to see the rimy dew that
had fallen on the sprouting grass, and which frequently
remained as late as nine o’clock; over the feathery Pennisetum
and the Agrostideæ it fell like a white veil, and the
bright drops sparkled like diamonds in the sunshine. The
slender gossamer, moreover, which stretched itself over the
deeps and shallows of the soil, and even over the footprints
in the ground, appeared to operate as a conductor of the dew,
which congealed till it was like a film of ice which crackles
beneath the tread of a traveller in the autumn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT ANT-HILLS.</div>

<p>Distant four and a half leagues to the south lay Aboo
Sammat’s head Seriba, known as Sabby, the name of its
Bongo chief. Half-way upon our march we crossed a considerable
stream, which was called the Koddy. As we forded
its breadth of twenty feet, we found the water rising above
our hips. Here again the candelabra-euphorbia seemed to
be abundant, after having never been seen since I left the
eastern bank of the river Dyoor. An essential feature of
the district between the Dyoor and the Kohl is contributed
by the small mushroom-shaped ant-hills which, found as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
are in many a part of Tropical Africa, here cover the stony
surface with their peculiar shapes. Formed exactly like the
common mushroom, the separate erections of the <i lang="la">Termes
mordax</i> are grouped in little colonies. The main difference
between the tenements of these ants and those which construct
conical domes as tall as a man, consists in this, that
they have a definite altitude, which rarely exceeds thirty
inches, and immediately that there is no further space they
raise new turrets and form fresh colonies. The materials,
too, of which this species of Termes constructs its edifice is
neither grey nor of a ferruginous red, but is simply the alluvial
clay of the place: it is so closely cemented together,
that it defies the most violent kicking to displace it, and is
hardly less solid than brickwork. The natives are very glad
to employ it for the construction of their huts; they break it
into fragments with their clubs, and moisten it till its substance
yields. By the Bongo it is called Kiddillikoo.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i349"></a>
<br>
 <img src="images/i_349.jpg"
 alt="white-ant hills">
 <p class="caption">Mushroom-shaped white-ant hills.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The red ferruginous clay is the only material out of which
the great ants (<i lang="la">Termes bellicosus</i>) construct their buildings.
These are seldom found elsewhere than in a wood, where the
pointed shapes are never seen. The neighbourhood of Sabby
especially abounded in these monuments of animal labour,
and not a few of them were fifteen feet in height. In altitude
greater than in breadth, they reared themselves like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
large cupola surrounded by countless pillars and projecting
towers. At the first commencement of the building it
embraces only some isolated domes, which gradually are
combined into one single cluster, whilst the ramifications of
the interior have entirely to be reconstructed. When we
reflect that the dimensions of the bodies of these toiling ants
(the female neuters) are not one thousandth part so great as
the structure that they upheave, we cannot refrain from comparing
their edifices with the most extensive cities which
human hands have reared. During my previous journey, I
had found several opportunities of investigating the secret
habits of these wondrous creatures. The life of the traveller
in Africa is one continual conflict against their aggressions.
Once at the missionary station in Gallabat, for seven days
did the people work away with crowbars to remove one of
these erections, which had been accumulated in the middle
of the courtyard, and which was not only an impediment in
the way, but was a nuisance to the adjacent huts. At length
they penetrated to the royal chamber, and dragged forth the
queen to the daylight, from which she had carefully excluded
her subjects.</p>

<p>All the ant-hills of which I was able to make a survey
were constructed upon the double-chamber system, the maze
of cells being divided apparently into two separate storeys.
Adequately to describe the marvellous interior of one of
these haunts of the community would require a volume of
itself. No labyrinth of coral could be more intricate; its
walls are curiously cemented together, its chambers are most
carefully arranged and most amply stored with vegetable
produce, and there are magazines which teem with cakes
and loaves. A regular series of bridges conducts from place
to place, and many a crossway traverses the pile. To detail
the wonders of these erections would tax the patience of the
reader, and the study of a life-time would not exhaust the
marvellous perfection of the organization which they present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOO SAMMAT’S HEAD SERIBA.</div>

<p>As might be conjectured, there is no want amongst these
woods of ant-hills such as these, which have ceased to be
occupied, and which consequently have been adopted as
lurking-places by various kinds of animals that shun the
light and lead a troglodite existence. Here skulks the aardvark
or earth-pig (<i lang="la">Orycteropus</i>); here gropes the African
armadillo (<i lang="la">Manis</i>); hither resort wild boars of many a breed;
here may be tracked the porcupines, the honey-weasel, or
ratel; here go the zebra-ichneumons and the rank civet-cats;
whilst here, perchance, may be found what in this land
is rare, an occasional hyæna.</p>

<p>Thus, after seven days’ journeying over a country all but
uninhabited, on the 23rd of November I found myself at the
head Seriba of my friend and protector, who received me with
true Oriental hospitality. First of all, he had newly-erected
for my use three pleasant huts, enclosed in their own fence;
his thoughtfulness had gone so far that he had provided me
with several chairs and tables; he had sent to a Seriba,
eight days’ journey distant, to obtain some cows, that I might
enjoy new milk every day; and, in short, he had taken the
utmost pains to insure me the best and amplest provisions
that the locality could supply. My attendants, too, who,
together with their slaves, made up a party of thirteen, were
entertained as freely as myself: everything contributed to
keep them in good mood, and they were delighted jointly
and severally to throw in their lot with mine.</p>

<p>The natives, when they saw not only their own superior,
but the governors of other Seribas, treat me with such consideration,
providing me with a palanquin for every brook,
came to the conclusion that I was a magnate, and said to
each other, “This white man is a lord over all the Turks”—&#8203;Turks
being the name by which the Nubians here wish to be
known, although before a genuine Osmanli they would not
have ventured to take such a title. As Aboo Sammat
used jocosely to remark, they were accustomed at home to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
carry mud, but here they carried a gun instead. It was a
matter of congratulation to myself that the people already
had arrived at some apprehension of the superiority of an
European. It set me at my ease to observe that I had
nothing to fear as to being mistaken by the natives for one
of the same stock as the Nubian menials. Equally advantageous
to me was it that the same impression prevailed
amongst the Niam-niam and the distant Monbuttoo, to whose
territories I was approaching, and accordingly I entered
upon my wanderings under what must be considered favourable
auspices.</p>

<p>Situated in a depression between undulating hills which
stretch from south-west to north-east, the settlement of Aboo
Sammat was surrounded by numerous Bongo villages and
fields. Here he centred an authority over his Bongo and
Mittoo territories which stretched away for no less than sixty
miles. The residence of Aboo himself was about a league
away, where he kept his harem in retirement, his elder
brother having the charge of the principal Seriba. After I
had settled myself as conveniently as I could, I began afresh
my accustomed rambles, so that, in the same way as I had
done in Ghatta’s Seriba, I might familiarise myself with all
the environs.</p>

<p>At this period, when vegetation was at a stand-still, the
flora presented little novelty, and whatever I found corresponded
very much with what I had already seen in the
district between the Tondy and the Dyoor. The woody
places around Sabby were generally somewhat thicker; there
was neither the same expanse of low steppe-country, nor the
same frequent interruption of woods by grassy plains. Corresponding
to this density of growth of the forests there was
a greater variety in the fauna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL IN SABBY.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, amidst my investigations, I did not lose sight of
my projected journey to the Niam-niam, and continually made
what preparation I could. I criticised very diligently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
muscles and measurements of the people, and very materially
enlarged my vocabulary. Although I was only half-way
towards the country of the Niam-niam, I found myself brought
into connection with a considerably large number of them, and
subsequently I was enabled in a degree to master their dialect.
The report of the feud between Mohammed Aboo Sammat
and Shereefee had extended to Mohammed’s outlying Seriba
in the Niam-niam country, and had grown into a rumour that
all his people had been exterminated by Shereefee’s agents.
For the purpose of obtaining more reliable information the
manager of the Seriba, ninety miles away, had sent ten
young men to Sabby, and their strange appearance very much
surprised me. Everything which I had hitherto seen of the
people served to strengthen my conviction that they were
marked off from the other population of Africa by a distinct
nationality of their own. Even the Bongo seemed here to
arouse my interest more than at Ghattas’s Seriba, where, on
account of their longer period of subjection, they had gradually
lost very many habits and peculiarities of their race.
I spent accordingly a good deal of my leisure in making
sketches of their dwellings and their furniture, and in my
numerous excursions round the villages, I persisted in investigating
everything, however immaterial it might seem, as
though I were examining the vestiges of the prehistoric life
of a palisaded colony.</p>

<p>The three slaves who accompanied me were now indispensable
as interpreters. Apart from them I could have
prevailed very little in overcoming the shyness and mistrust
towards strangers which the natives continually exhibited:
an exterior survey did not satisfy me, and I persevered till I
gained admittance to the inside of several of the huts, so that
I could institute a regular domestic investigation. Every
corner was explored, and by this means many a strange
implement was brought to light, and many an unexpected
discovery revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>The granaries of the Bongo were now quite full, as the
harvest was just over: all was consequently mirth and riot
in the district, and many a night’s rest did I find disturbed
by the noisy orgies which re-echoed from the shadowy woods.
At full blast for hours together were the long wooden
trumpets, the loud signal-horns, the huge trombones, and
those immense drums for the construction of which the
strongest timber has been selected from the forests. The
powers of shrieking were put forth to the uttermost. Like
the rolling of the breakers of an angry sea, the noise rose
and fell: alternate screechings and howlings reached my
ears, and hundreds of men and women seemed to be trying
which could scream the loudest. Incapable of closing an
eye for sleep while such infernal outcry was around, I went
several times to inspect the frantic scene of merriment.
Nights when the moon was bright were those most frequently
selected for the boisterous revelry; the excuse alleged being
that the mosquitoes would not let them rest, and therefore it
was necessary to dance; but in truth, there was no nuisance
of flies here worth consideration: I was not annoyed to anything
like the same extent as upon my backward journey on
the White Nile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORGIES OF THE NIGHT.</div>

<p>The following may be submitted as something like an
ordinary programme of these <i lang="fr">soirées musicales</i>. Slowly and
mournfully some decrepit old man, or toothless old woman,
begins with broken voice to babble out a doleful recitative;
ere long first one and then another will put in an appearance
from the surrounding huts, and point with the forefinger at
the original performer, as if to say that this is all his fault,
when suddenly, all together, they burst forth in universal
chorus, taking up the measure, which they work into a
wondrous fugue. At a given signal the voices rise in a
piercing shriek, and then ensues a series of incredible contortions;
they jump, they dance, and roll themselves about as
though they had bodies of indian-rubber; they swing themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
as if they were propelled with the regularity of
machines; it would almost seem as if their energy were
inexhaustible, and as if they would blow their trumpets till
their lungs gave way, and hammer at their drums till their
fists were paralyzed. All at once everything is hushed;
simultaneously they make a pause; but it is only to fetch
their breath and recover their strength, and once more the
tumult breaks out intense as ever. The license of their
revelry is of so gross a character that the representation of
one of my interpreters must needs be suppressed. It made
a common market-woman droop her eyes and called up a
blush even to a poor sapper’s cheek. Many of the people
had iron rings about their ankles with balls attached, and
these they rattled with such violence that their feet were
bathed with blood.</p>

<p>Go where I might, I found nothing but lamentation over
the impoverishment and desolation of the land, yet those who
complained were themselves responsible for its comfortless
aspect. Whilst, through the migration of the people, the
country towards the north during the last three years had
been changed into a wilderness, the Bongo, who clung to their
homes and remained on their settlements, had not only lost
their former wealth in sheep, goats, and poultry, but had
even been too much driven to extremities to continue their
cultivation of corn, and were sufferers from what was little
short of famine. The Bongo asserted that in the first year
that the Khartoomers committed their depredations amongst
them, they were so terrified lest all their sheep, and goats,
and poultry should be carried off, that, without delay, they
had them all killed, cooked, and eaten. Eye-witnesses were
not wanting who told me what had been the astonishing
quantities of poultry that once had teamed in every village;
but when there ceased to be any security for any one to
retain what he had, of course there ceased to be any interest
in making a store. If the harvest were prolific so that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
granaries were full, the settlers would revel in indulgence
as long as their resources held out; but for the greater
portion of the year they had to depend upon the produce of
the woods and upon the proceeds of the chase, which had
often no better game to yield than cats, lizards, and field-rats.
Not that there was any actual fear of starvation,
because the supply of edible tubers and of wild fruits from
the extensive woods was inexhaustible and not ill-adapted to
a negro’s digestion, and because there was an abundance of
the seed of wild grasses to be collected, which replaced the
scarcity of corn.</p>

<p>In productiveness the land around Sabby was not inferior
to the environs of Ghattas’s Seriba. The ears of sorghum
here, as frequently as there, reached to a weight of six pounds;
but at the same time the level tracts under cultivation were
far less extensive, and in all the rocky places could only
produce a smaller yield. The natives, however, never
ventured to bring any of their grain to market, as I had been
accustomed to see them: whatever anyone possessed, he
cautiously kept out of the sight of the stranger. From
all regular and systematic agriculture, the natives were as a
rule debarred, because in the course of the year nearly every
able-bodied man was compelled to go and do duty as a
bearer, and consequently for months together was a stranger
to his homestead, whilst he either plodded backwards and
forwards to the Meshera, or was engaged upon the Niam-niam
expeditions. Of copper, beads, and knick-knacks of every
sort they managed to increase their store, but in agriculture
they decidedly were retrograding. It was with them precisely
as with their oppressors from afar: just as in Nubia,
there was a destiny of evil being fulfilled upon the land, so
here was the spectacle of a region degenerating from prosperity
into neglect and woe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOAT-SUCKERS.</div>

<p>Repeatedly in the evening hours I watched the ghost-like
fluttering of a long feathered goat-sucker of the species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
<i lang="la">Cosmetornis Spekii Sclater</i>, observed by Speke<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in Uganda,
and which was to be recognized by the astonishing elongation
of the seventh and eighth wing-quills, the latter of which
reaches over twenty inches in length. There was a second
species of this genus, of which the male had the same
kind of prolonged shaft-feathers expanded at the end and
fluttering in the air like a peacock’s tail. This was the
<i lang="la">Macrodypterix longipennis</i>, a remarkable bird which the
Arabs call the “father of four wings,” because, as it chases
the mice, it looks as though it had a couple of satellites
in attendance. Both these make their earliest appearance
about a quarter of an hour after sunset and as the twilight
passes rapidly into thorough night; I had, therefore, only
scanty opportunities of sending what were at best only stray
shots to bring them down. For the purpose of catching
insects they generally wheeled in circles at no great
distance from the ground, but as the range of their flight
was very circumscribed and its rapidity extremely great, it
was somewhat difficult to get a good aim. However, as
the practice was repeated daily, I succeeded in securing a
considerable number of Speke’s interesting <i lang="la">Cosmetornis</i>. I
should mention that while I had been in Ghattas’s Seriba,
sport of this kind had very frequently been an evening
recreation. The antipathy of this aëronaut of the dusky
evening to the clear light of day, seemed very remarkable:
it kept itself to the seclusion of the low bushwoods, and when
roused up would disappear again at the first ray of light;
often it would settle itself on the ground in a pile of leaves
to which its own hue corresponded, and it might then almost
be trodden upon before it could be stirred into flight.</p>

<p>During the incessant excursions which I kept making
round Sabby I was able to discriminate not less than twelve
distinct species of antelopes, of which I was successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
in shooting several. Frequently met with here is the
antelope (<i lang="la">A. oreas</i>) which is known as the Elend. During
the rainy months it gathers in little groups of about half-a-dozen
in the drier districts on the heights, but through the
winter it is, like all its kindred, confined to the levels by the
river-sides. Upon the steppes through which flow the brooklets
in the proximity of Sabby the leucotis antelope is the most
common of all game, and many is the herd I saw which might
be reckoned at a hundred heads. Perhaps nowhere in the
whole of North-east Africa would any one have the chance of
seeing such numerous herds of antelopes collected together as
travellers in the south are accustomed to depict. Assisted by
a whole clan of Kaffirs, the Boers on the 24th of August, 1860,
had a <i lang="fr">battue</i> in Honour of the Duke of Edinburgh, of which the
result was that between 20,000 and 30,000 antelopes are said
to have been enclosed. Of the more circumscribed district
of the Nile the parts that are most prolific in game are on
the north-west declivity of the Abyssinian highlands, on the
Tacazze or Seteet, in the province of Taka: there it is not
an unknown circumstance for herds to be found which exceed
a total of 400 head, but they do not correspond in the
remotest degree with those which are depicted in the published
engravings of the South African hunt. Still poorer in numbers
of individuals are the antelopes in Central Africa proper,
where the uniform diffusion of men encloses smaller wastes
than those which can alone provide large lairs for game.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZEBRA-ICHNEUMON: MUCUNA URENS.</div>

<p>Amongst the numerous smaller beasts of prey to which
the regions that I visited gave harbourage, the zebra-ichneumon
was to me one of the most interesting. I was very
successful in securing living specimens of this widely-scattered
species, and could not suppress my astonishment at the
facility with which they were domesticated in my dwelling;
if ever they get established in a house there is no getting rid
of them. It is a saucy creature, and has neither fear to show
nor submission to yield to the authority of man. It resembles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
the wild cat of the steppes in the ease with which it can be
accustomed to a home life. I found it exceedingly troublesome
on account of the pertinacious curiosity with which it
peeped into all my cases and boxes, upset my pots, broke
my bottles, with no apparent object but to investigate the
contents. To accomplish its aim it made incessant use of its
long, taper, snuffling snout as a lever. But the most vexatious
art of which the animal was master was the skill it had
in scenting out the spots where my hens were accustomed to
lay their eggs, and of which it learnt the flavour before I had
an opportunity of removing them to a place of safety. It is
moreover a tricky little animal; by whisking and wagging
its tail it assumes the appearance of fawning and wheedling,
but as soon as anyone touches it, he gets a good bite on his
finger. When hunted out and followed by dogs, it throws
itself down on its back, kicks its legs about, and grins and
gnashes with its teeth. To keep clear of being bitten the
best way is to pounce upon it by its tail and to let it hang
dangling in the air.</p>

<p>One morning there arrived at the Seriba from the far
distant boundaries of the Bongo several wild-looking men,
armed with bows and arrows. In order to satisfy myself of
the effectiveness of their weapons, I set up a mark at a short
distance, consisting of an earthen vessel, in front of which I
placed a good thick pad of straw, and over all I threw a
stout serge coat. Defying all the coverings, the arrow
penetrated the coat, made its way through the straw and
knocked a hole in the earthenware, which was nearly half-an-inch
thick.</p>

<p>A plant there is here which is not very likely to be forgotten
by anyone who has made many excursions into the
woods: I mean the <i lang="la">Mucuna urens</i>. It is a sort of bean, of
which the pods are enclosed in a thick rind and the leaves are
covered with pungent bristles. These bristles are as brittle
as fibres of glass and, broken off by the wind, are dispersed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
all directions over the foliage in the forests. No one who
explores the thickets can escape being punished by these tiny
prickles. The natives, who are naked, go amongst them with
the extremest caution. The stinging sensation they cause
lasts about ten minutes, but it may be alleviated by washing.</p>

<p>There is a kind of Christ’s Thorn (<i lang="la">Zizyphus Baclei</i>) which
every December yields an abundance of fruit, consisting of
dry mealy berries, which have a very bitter taste. The colour
of these is not unlike a chestnut; they are quite unfit for
eating, but the Bongo prepare a powder from them which
they throw upon the surface of their waters, and it has the
effect of stupefying the fish.</p>

<p>In the parched steppe I repeatedly found a huge chafer
belonging to the family of the Elateridæ, but unfortunately
the specimens which I secured, together with my other
collection of insect curiosities, were all destroyed by fire;
and I have now no other reminiscences of them beyond
the notes I took that they were of a bright brown colour
and were but little short of two inches and a half in length.</p>

<p>Of the few larger shrubs which blow in the winter, an
Echinops, with splendid purple blossoms as large as one’s
hand, left a deep impression on my recollection. They start
out of the grass in situations where the woods are not over-dense,
and rise to the height of a man. For the sake of the
security of what has been styled a “protective resemblance,”
the mantis takes up its quarters amidst its boughs. Just as
the leaf-frog secretes itself on the young and light green
foliage, or the white ptarmigan resorts to the snowy downs of
the frozen north, so does the mantis here take up its abode
on the tree as purple as itself, and there endeavour to find a
world in which it may conceal its singular shape. This part
of Africa seemed to produce many species of this remarkable
genus. Whenever I saw them I derived fresh confirmation
for my belief that they try to adapt their places of resort to
the specific colours of their bodies: the result of this is, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
they often startle the plant-collector as if they were ghosts,
and their strange shape is indeed somewhat suggestive of a
harpy. At first sight the heads of the Echinops, on which
they settle, look like malformations of the shrub itself, for
the insect uncoils its arms, and like a suppliant lifts them to
the sky. Every variety in colour seems to belong to the
mantis; I have seen them red, yellow, green, and brown;
the most remarkable of all was one of the colour of grass,
which I found upon the peak of my hut in the Meshera, and
which was of the surprising length of ten inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIONS.</div>

<p>Around Sabby the general security was so complete that,
quite at my ease and entirely unarmed, I might have ranged
the woods if there had been a certain immunity from being
attacked by lions; and against this I was compelled to be on
my guard as I penetrated the depths of the wilderness to
secure the novelties of vegetation, which could not fail
to excite my curiosity. Although my vocation constrained
me day after day to explore the recesses of the woods more
thoroughly, and to make my way through places hitherto
inaccessible, yet I never met with any untoward accident.
At home I am quite aware that there are some who entertain
the idea that every traveller in Central Africa is engaged in
perpetual lion-fights, whilst, on the other hand, there are
some who make the insinuating inquiry as to whether lions
are ever really seen. In a degree both are right—&#8203;both are in
the avenue of truth. Lions are, in fact, universal, and <em>may</em> be
met with anywhere; but their numbers are not absolutely
large, but only proportioned to the princely rank they hold
in the scale of animal creation. Their appearance is always
a proof of the proximity of the larger kinds of game. Corresponding
to the line in history, which tells that forty generations
of Mamelooks tyrannized over the people of Egypt,
might be registered the line in the records of the animal
kingdom, which might run that forty lions found subsistence
in the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<p>It is not to be presumed that every hunting excursion in
Africa is associated with adventure. Such is far from the
fact, and it would be utterly wearisome for me to recount
every frivolous incident of my ordinary hunt in quest of game
for the table. Even in Africa a chase may be as insipid as
coursing a hare in the environs of Paris. Shooting and
hitting are two different things, as are also hitting and killing
on the spot. So great is found to be the nervous resistance
of the larger and stronger kinds of game in Africa that
the sportsman must be prepared to lose at least 70 per cent.
of all that he is able to wound; this will arise not merely
from his being destitute of dogs to follow the scent, but from
his continually finding himself baffled in pursuit by the
world of grass and of marshes, through which he is obliged
to make his way. When on the march, another obstacle to
securing what is shot often arises from the fear of being left
behind by the caravan, and the possibility of losing one’s
way necessitates a despatch which is unfavourable to success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD BOAR SHOT.</div>

<p>One afternoon the chase after a considerable troop of
hartebeests led me deep into the wood. The cunning animals
watched my movements very anxiously; by stopping repeatedly
they enticed me continually further on into the
gloom, and still eluded the chance of giving me a shot. Already
had I penetrated so far into the forest that the rays of the
sun were totally lost, and everything was wrapped in the
obscurity of twilight; I was about to make my way over a
depression in the ground, to get nearer to an elevation from
which the antelopes were calmly surveying me, when I suddenly
stumbled over some huge shapeless object, which
seemed to me to be moving. Owing to the obscurity of the
place I could not distinguish anything, but I found there
was an ant-hill close by, of which I endeavoured to make
some use; under the protection of this I made an attempt
to get a few steps nearer to the enigmatical creature that
lay before me; from behind the mound I cautiously made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
an investigation, and just at that instant the animal made a
lurch, and revealed to me the snout of a huge wild boar,
which seemed to cover the whole face like a mask, while a
great pair of tusks projected from the bushy bristles of the
enormous jaws; the stolid gaze of the brute made it clear
that it was not conscious of my being near, but it seemed
ready to take a spring upon the first intruder that should
disturb it; I approached within the shortest possible distance,
and then took aim, and lodged my bullet in the body
of the beast. The spectacle that ensued was very singular.
The unwieldy creature, contracted like an impaled fly, turned
over on to its side, and then, with another contortion, on to
its back, where it writhed about and jerked its legs in every
direction. Whilst I was patiently abiding my time till the
beast should expire, I was taken by surprise as I observed
that the hartebeests were within pistol-shot of where I stood,
as if they had been spell-bound by the incident which had
interposed to rescue them from their pursuer. I was ready
anew to take my aim at them. I had, however, only a single-barrelled
gun, and no one in attendance to hand me a second.
I was just on the point of loading, when, by one of those
unlucky chances that will occur, I discovered that in my precipitation
I had used all my bullets, and should only waste
my labour in following up the pursuit. The wild boar, however,
was mine, and I had it brought to my quarters the
same evening. I went to bed without partaking of a supper
from it, for whenever there is anything to do with the detestable
flesh of a wart-hog, I am a regular Mohammedan.
Accordingly, I had the greatest satisfaction in handing it
over to the hungry negroes.</p>

<p>An incident still more peculiar had occurred to me on a
previous occasion when I had gone out to hunt, attended by
one of my Nubians, who rode a donkey, of which the supposed
office was to carry home whatever might be the produce of
my sport. I left my servant and the donkey carefully out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
of sight in a spot where two rifts in the soil represented
what, during the rains, was the course of two connected
brooks. Proceeding to the tall grass, I was not long in sighting
a small bush-antelope. I took a shot, and could entertain
no doubt but that the animal was struck. I saw it scamper
across the grass, and was every moment expecting to see it
fall, when I heard a sudden bleat of anguish, and it was gone.
Forcing my way through the rank grass, I made the closest
scrutiny all around the place where, but a few minutes since,
I had seen the wounded antelope, but my search was all in
vain. I was encumbered in my movements by having to
carry a couple of guns; but, knowing that the area of the
ground was bounded by the two rifts that enclosed it, I felt
certain that my search would not be without success. At
length I discovered the antelope almost at my feet, but it
was fixed immovably; it was fastened to the ground by what
seemed to me at first the filthy skirt of one of the negroes.
Looking more closely, however, I soon saw that the creature
had been seized by an immense serpent, that had wound
itself three times round its body, leaving its head projecting
and drawn down so as well nigh to touch the tail I retreated
far enough to take an effectual aim, and fired. The huge
python immediately reared itself bolt upright, and made a
dash in my direction, but it was able only to erect its head;
the hinder parts lay trailing on the ground, because the vertebral
connection was destroyed. Seeing the state of things,
I loaded and fired repeatedly, taking my aim almost at random,
for the evolutions of a snake are as difficult to follow
as the flight of the goat-sucker. I had on other occasions
proved that a snake may be killed by one ordinary load of
shot, if this at once breaks the vertebral column. I now
completed my capture; the return to my quarters was made
in triumph; the double booty formed a double burden, the
snake on one side of the donkey and the antelope on the
other, balancing each other admirably.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<p class="footnote unindent"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> The phenomenon here depicted is closely allied to those tinted halos
which are seen in so much diversity and under so many modifications around
both sun and moon. In Schumacher’s ‘Astronomische Jahrbücher’ (Altona,
1823) Fraunhofer has detailed the theory of these halos, and has proved his
assertions by many examples that had fallen under his own observation.
Whenever the sun or the moon is surrounded by a halo, the sky is ordinarily
veiled in light vapours. If the phenomenon is perfect, the rings of this halo
are seen to be of the colours of the rainbow. Fraunhofer divides these halos
into two classes: viz., halos of a small and halos of a large diameter. If the
red tint is outside and away from the luminous body, as in the present case, he
calls it a halo of the smaller kind; but if the red is inside and next to the
luminous body, it is a halo of the larger kind. This latter case is closely
allied to the phenomenon of parhelia. The cause of these tinted halos is to be
found in a diffraction of light through globules of vapour, and Fraunhofer has
given proof that the light, in passing across the edges of these globules, would
assume an appearance of diffraction similar to that which would be caused by
its passing through minute apertures. For the formation of a tinted circle it
is necessary that the globules should be equally diffused and of an equal
magnitude. If the globules were very irregular, there would be only a bright
glare, because the eye would receive rays of various colours from one and the
same spot in the atmosphere; then the result would be that the light would be
white, as in the case under our notice it appeared directly round the outline of
the cloud, and also beyond the outside ring of red, so that the coloured circle
was bounded on each side by a rim of white light. The smaller the globules
of vapour, the larger are the tinted rings, for according to the theory the diameters
of the rings are in inverse ratio to those of the globules. According to
another theory represented by Galle (Poggendorf’s ‘Annalen,’ <abbr title="volume forty-nine">vol. xlix.</abbr>), one
cause of these tinted halos is the presence in the atmosphere of ice-crystals of
microscopic minuteness; but this hypothesis seems confuted by the fact that
similar phenomena have frequently been witnessed within the tropics (Alex.
von Humboldt, Voyage <abbr title="Two, page">II., p.</abbr> 309). This phenomena of the 18th of May, 1869,
was remarkable for the form of the tinted circle, which corresponded exactly
with the accidental outline of the clouds, which presented a threefold curve,
thus 
 <img src="images/symbol.jpg"
 alt="symbol">
. Thus the entire rim of the cloud became a series of luminous
sunlight points formed of globules of vapour, making a halo of the smaller
class, and sending forth their own shadows.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I spent</span> December and January in a tour of considerable
extent through the adjacent Mittoo country, being desirous
of visiting some Seribas recently established by Aboo
Sammat, and by means of which he had extended his
frontiers far onwards towards the east. I obtained ten
bearers for the transport of my baggage, and a Nubian
captain of Aboo Sammat’s company was expressly appointed
to act as guide and to provide for my accommodation all
along the route. I was accompanied likewise by three of my
own Khartoom servants.</p>

<p>A short journey to the north-east brought us to Boiko,
where, enclosed by a dense forest, was situated Aboo Sammat’s
harem. A lady here, the first wife, a daughter of the
Niam-niam chief Wando, although she did not permit herself
to be seen, was near at hand to do the honours: she was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
far civilized that she entertained me with coffee and several
Khartoom dishes.</p>

<p>Proceeding eastwards we reached the little river Tudyee,
which, flowing past Sabby at a distance of about two leagues
to the east, ultimately joins the Roah (the Nam Dyow of the
Dinka); at this time of year it is about twenty feet deep,
and murmurs along a channel from twenty to thirty feet
wide; now and then it forms deep basins, which never fail to
be full of fish. We made our first night-camp near a fine
tamarind, which will probably for years to come be a landmark
as conspicuous as it was at the time of my visit; it
was the usual halting-place of all caravans from east to west,
and the traces of previous encampments, dilapidated straw-hats,
vestiges of fires and fragments of bones bore ample
testimony to the fact.</p>

<p>At this season a slight dew was perceptible towards five
o’clock in the morning. The nights were calm and, in
comparison with the day, were considerably cooler than in
summer, when in the interior of the huts there is hardly any
difference in temperature to be distinguished. Throughout
the day, however, a strong north wind blew incessantly,
which towards the afternoon increased almost to a hurricane.
There is a peculiar charm in these early morning
hours, and no one can wake from his repose in a night-camp
in the wilderness without a sense of calm enjoyment of the
delights of nature. As soon as the horizon reddens with
the dawn the solitude is enlivened by a chorus of ring-doves,
here the most frequent of their kind, and by the cackling
of guinea-fowl. The traveller is aroused daily by their
serenades, and, without much strain upon his imagination,
he could almost persuade himself that he has been long
resident in the same spot, so familiar does the cooing of the
doves become.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARRIED OFF BY A LION.</div>

<p>As we were preparing to continue our march, some people
came to meet us with some dismal intelligence from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
neighbouring village of Geegyee. They said that on the
previous night a Nubian soldier, who had laid himself down
at the door of his hut, about five paces from the thorn hedge,
had been seized by a lion, and, before he could raise an alarm
had been dragged off no one knew whither. I now learnt,
that this district had for some years been infested with lions,
and that lately the casualties had been so frequent that the
greater part of the inhabitants of Geegyee had migrated in
consequence. The entire village would have been transplanted
long ago, but the lions had been always found to
follow every change of position. At seven o’clock in the
morning we reached the ill-omened spot, the poorest of
neglected villages, surrounded by woods. A thorn hedge
formed its enclosure but nowhere could we discover an
entrance. Although the sun was now high, the inhabitants,
terrified lest the lions should be near, were still sitting
either on the tops of their roofs or on the piles that supported
their granaries. Speechless and depressed with fear,
my people proceeded on their journey: every one kept his
gun in hand, and the bearers, listening anxiously at every
rustle that broke the stillness, peered carefully after any
traces of the dreaded foe.</p>

<p>After a good day’s march we arrived at Aboo Sammat’s
Seriba Dokkuttoo, lying on the extreme east of the frontier
of the Bongo; it was about twenty miles from the chief Seriba
Sabby, being somewhat further to the south. Half a league
before we reached Dokkuttoo we had crossed a considerable,
though only periodical stream, called the Mokloio. It was
now five feet deep, meandering over a low flat fifty feet wide
to join the Roah.</p>

<p>The Roah is a river of about the same size as the Tondy,
with which it finally unites itself; it here makes a remarkable
bend from south-east to north-east, but its general
direction for some distance in this district is due north;
the stream flowed between banks twenty or thirty feet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
height; its average width was full forty feet, whilst it was
only three feet deep; the velocity of the current was one
hundred and twenty feet a minute. The grass flat covered
by the Roah at the time of its inundation is not so wide
as that covered by the Tondy at Koolongo; it measured
barely half a league across, and I therefore conclude that this
river carries northward a volume of water smaller than the
Tondy.</p>

<p>The Bongo were most assiduous in securing the large
supplies of fish offered by the Roah. Across the stream in
many places was thrown a kind of weir like a <i lang="fr">chevaux de
frise</i>; this they stopped up with bunches of grass and so
formed a small dam; over the open places were set creels,
and altogether a rich produce rarely failed to be obtained.
Some miles up the river, where the banks are shut in by
impenetrable reeds, is a favourite resort of hippopotamuses,
and it was said that, two years previously, the natives had
killed no less than thirty in a single day. The brutes
had been driven by the low condition of the water to seek
the deeper basins of the river-bed, whence all escape was
impossible.</p>

<p>We remained in Dokkuttoo for two days, of which I made
the most by excursions in the neighbourhood. A small
slave caravan, containing one hundred and fifty girls and
children, happened to be passing through the Seriba; it was
conducted by traders coming from Ghattas’s and Agahd’s
territory in the east. The whole party huddled together for
the night in a couple of huts, several old female slaves being
entrusted with the supervision of the children. I was a
witness of the arrangements for the evening meal, and,
contrary to my expectation, found that everything was
conducted with much system and regularity. The old
Bongo people of the neighbouring villages had brought fifty
bowls of dokhn-groats, and as many more containing sauces
prepared from sesame-oil, Hyptis-pap, and dried and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
powdered meat or fish, and other comestibles of gourds and
wild Melochia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORCED PROVISIONS.</div>

<p>My own entertainment was well provided for, and the
agent had an extra bullock slaughtered in order that my
little company should not proceed without the supply of
meat necessary for the journey. Every mouthful of food
that I swallowed in this unhappy country was a reproach to
the conscience, but the voice of hunger drowned every higher
emotion; even the bread that we ate had been forced from
the very poorest in the season of their harvest when their
joy, such as it was, was at its height; they probably had
neither cow nor goat, and their little children were in peril
of dying of starvation and only dragged out a miserable
existence by scraping up roots. The meat, in the abundance
of which we were revelling, had been stolen from poor
savages, who pay almost a divine homage to their beasts, and
who answer with their blood for the stubbornness with which
they defend their cows, which they hold dearer than wife or
child.</p>

<p>Leaving Dokkuttoo, we proceeded for three leagues to the
south, passing through the light bushwood that skirted the
left bank of the Roah. The woods lay close down to the
river as it flowed between its rocky banks. We crossed the
stream near some huts, already inhabited by Mittoo, of
which the name of the local chief was Degbe. Further
south our path again and again crossed wide meadow-flats
containing water-basins almost as large as lakes, which, as
they had no perceptible current, had every appearance of
being ancient beds of the Roah. Several larger kinds of
antelopes, water-bucks, and hartebeests appeared, and a herd
of thirty leucotis challenged me to a chase. At night, at
our bivouac in the forest, we enjoyed in consequence a fine
feast of the savoury game. Between the Roah and the Rohl
the previous uniformity of the rocks began to be broken by
projections of gneiss and by scattered hills. About ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
leagues from Ngahma we passed a remarkable spot of this
kind, where huge blocks of stone rose in mounds from which
colossal obelisks might be hewn. These elevated places
alternated with extensive flats level as a table top.</p>

<p>Ngahma was Aboo Sammat’s most important settlement
amongst the Mittoo. It lies in a <abbr title="south south-east">S.S.E.</abbr> direction from
Dokkuttoo and derives its name from the elder of the people,
who, with his twenty wives, resides at no great distance; by
the natives it is called Mittoo-mor. From Ngahma I turned
north-east towards Dimindoh, a small settlement of elephant-hunters
belonging to Ghattas’s “Gebel company,” as the
people style his establishments on the Bahr-el-Gebel. The
district was the highest elevation between the Roah and the
Rohl, the country being more diversified by defiles, clefts, and
periodic streams than that which I had previously traversed.
Dimindoh lay on the further bank of a little river called the
Wohko, which, during our march, we had repeatedly to cross.
The stream flows over a course of some seventy miles without
any perceptible increase in its dimensions, a peculiarity
that I have again and again observed in many other small
rivers, which seem to flow across wide tracts of country
unchanged in their condition by the affluence of any spring
or running brook.</p>

<p>An excellent reception awaited me in Dimindoh. The
hunting-village had been lately built of straw and bamboo at
a large outlay, and there were regular straw palaces, of which
the new domes and roofs gleamed with all the golden glory
of Ceres. To say the very least, our rest was quite undisturbed
by rats, and the idyllic abodes still retained the
pleasant aroma of the meadows. I had no cause to complain
of the entertainment in any of the smaller Seribas. I was
always supplied with milk and with all kinds of meal. The
traditional spirit-distillery of Ghattas’s people was here also
in full swing, and they brought to me, in gourd-shells, a
concoction which was not so utterly bad as that at Gurfala.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATMENT OF WOUNDS.</div>

<p>I was, however, much bewildered by the constant solicitations
for my medical advice. Amongst other cases they
brought me a Nubian, who, on his excursions, had received
such cuts from the grass that his feet had completely rotted
away, leaving the tendons still hanging. These people have
no rational way of treating their wounds, but when there is
any inflammation they endeavour to allay it by corn-poultices
and hot water, a proceeding which always aggravates the
evil. I saw some who had lost several toes, and others who
had the most revolting sores on the shins and insteps, and
in nearly every case these had arisen from insignificant cuts
which, simply from mismanagement, had terminated in
disease.</p>

<p>“It is a strange thing,” I said to them, “that the grass is
only bad <em>here</em>; it must be something more than that; it is a
punishment from God.”</p>

<p>“But God,” they answered, “does not give us such grass
in Dongola; this is a bad country.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say then,” I replied, “that God is kind
in Dongola, and unkind here? No; I tell you, God is
Himself punishing you for all your thievery, because there
is here no other ruler to look after your misdeeds.”</p>

<p>I felt that I was quite justified in talking in this fashion to
a people who, under the cloak of religion, are as unscrupulous
rascals as any in the world, and who, misinterpreting the
mottoes on their banners which incite them to war against
the infidel, consider all plunder perpetrated on defenceless
savages as heroic actions bearing them onwards to the palms
of Paradise.</p>

<p>The chief Seriba of this eastern section of Ghattas’s establishments
lies only a league and a half to the north-east
of Dimindoh, and was called Dangadduloo, after a certain
Danga, who had been appointed the head of the Mittoo of
the district. In 1863 the brothers Poncet of Khartoom had
ceded to Ghattas their settlements amongst the Agar, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
Rohl, in order to found fresh establishments in the following
year near the cataracts of that river, among the Lehssy. The
Agar, as I have already mentioned, had managed to obtain
possession of a considerable quantity of firearms and ammunition,
and had made themselves so formidable that the
Khartoomers had not ventured to rebuild the Seriba that
had been destroyed: for that reason, the settlements of
Ghattas had receded southwards to the region in which I now
found myself. Our road lay often across wide gneiss flats,
which not unfrequently exhibited the same uniformity for
several hundred yards together. From the surface the stone
broke off in smooth laminæ, often as thin as the cover of a
book, and afforded me a convenient material for pressing my
packets of plants. We had crossed the Wohko for the
second time at Dimindoh, where its bed was about fifteen feet
deep: its course is generally due north, but here it bends at
a right angle to the east, as if seeking the shortest route to
join the Rohl. The little river abounds in shells, especially
in Anodontæ, which are turned to many domestic uses by
the natives, while the massive <i lang="la">Etheria Cailliaudii</i>, not unlike
the oyster, forms continuous banks in all these minor streams.</p>

<p>In Dangadduloo I found two applicants both eager to
obtain the appointment as superintendent of the Seriba.
One of these had accompanied the last caravan of supplies
from Khartoom, and now was not acknowledged in the
Seriba by the soldiers, who reproached him for having
acted fraudulently. He was a Copt, and, as far as I know,
the first and last Khartoom Christian who ever ventured
amongst this set of fanatics. The other agent, named Selim,
was a negro over six feet high, and by birth a Dinka; he
had the majority of the inhabitants of the Seriba on his
side, and lived in continual contention with his rival about
the surrender of the stores brought from Khartoom. Both
of these men received me with a great show of friendship,
and each strove to outdo the other in politeness; they considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
that a great deal might depend upon the answer
that I should give their master on my return to Khartoom,
when he would probably ask my opinion of their respective
merits. Each maligned the other, and almost in the same
terms; they were both, moreover, throughout the two days
which I spent with them more or less in a state of
intoxication.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLD CUP.</div>

<p>Wherever I entered a Seriba there was almost invariably
brought to my hut, according to the Soudan fashion of
receiving strangers, a cooling draught, consisting of a kind
of <em>cold cup</em> called Abrey. It was made in the simplest
manner from highly-leavened bread, dried and crumbled
into water; its flavour is agreeable, and travellers can
hardly say too much in its favour: it is a preparation,
however, that can only be made of sorghum bread. In
addition to this the people are accustomed, according to
patriarchal usage, to bring water to wash the stranger’s
feet. When there preliminaries had been gone through,
I had then to take my seat upon the “angareb” or couch,
which was generally covered with an elegant Persian carpet,
and to await the visits that would be made me.</p>

<p>A succession of unknown personages ordinarily came,
who made a reverent salaam and then silently and with
mysterious air placed before me flasks, calabashes, and
gourd-shells containing butter, milk, honey, spirits, merissa—&#8203;in
short, every delicacy that the country could offer. My
people revelled in this abundance, and ever rejoiced at the
happy thought which had impelled me to this tour, and
that I had brought them from a land threatened with
famine into this region of corn and cattle. The fact of a
large number of the herds having been stolen, and that
the territory was adjacent to the territory that had been
plundered, gave rise to the risk of a nocturnal attack by
way of reprisal: on this account numerous watches were
set every night and the environs were patrolled, but no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
sooner had the sun gone down than the entire community
abandoned themselves to a general intoxication, so that I
should never have been astonished if the Dinka had ventured
on a surprise, which would have had every likelihood
of being crowned with success.</p>

<p>The Mittoo of this district are called Gheree. Southwards
and far to the east of the Rohl the general name of Moro
is applied to the country, and as tribes of distinct people
have settled there, it may no doubt be considered as a true
geographical designation of the land itself; it is, however,
the only example which came under my notice throughout
the entire region of the appellation of the people and the
land not being identical.</p>

<p>Favoured by the partial destruction of the high grass
by fire, the natives were diligently setting about their
great hunt. Battues, with nets, pits, and snares, were set
on foot in every direction; the strong bows with curved
handles, by means of which a lasso can by skill be thrown
round a buffalo’s legs, being in general use. In the villages
I observed many trophies of the chase in the shape of some
splendid horns of buffaloes and eland-antelopes.</p>

<p>As I went on due east towards the Rohl, I was obliged to
be carried, on account of having a sore foot. This I found a
matter of some difficulty, on account of the want of any
suitable litter, and because the paths are all so narrow that
there is no space for two persons to move abreast, while
the difficulty was still further increased by the negroes refusing
to carry the heavy angarebs in any way except upon
their heads. Wherever Islamism has its sway in Africa, it
appears never to be the fashion for any one to allow himself
to be carried: this arises from a religious scruple which
might with advantage be applied by Europeans to nations
under their protection. A strict Mohammedan reckons it
an actual sin to employ a man as a vehicle, and such a
sentiment is very remarkable in a people who set no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
limits to their spirit of oppression. It is a known fact that
a Mohammedan, though he cannot refuse to recognise a
negro, denying the faith, as being <em>a man</em>, has not the faintest
idea of his being entitled to any rights of humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IDENTIFICATION OF ROUTE.</div>

<p>The country on the left bank of the Wohko appeared
well cultivated, and we frequently passed through fields
from which crops of Penicillaria had been gathered. Three
leagues from Dangadduloo there was some low meadow land,
and, for the first time since leaving the Dyoor, I saw an
extensive range of Borassus palms, their lofty stems, 80
feet in height, crowned with waving plumes of fan-shaped
leaves. Beneath their shade nestled the huts of the Mittoo
chief Bai, with whom we took our noonday rest. In the
afternoon we retraced our steps for a couple of leagues, in
order to put up for the night in the village of another chief,
named Gahdy. Towards the north-east some important
heights now showed themselves on the horizon beyond the
Rohl, and after awhile I was able to settle certain angles
so as to determine their relative bearings. By this means,
for the first time, I ascertained that my route must be near
the points which had been reached by former travellers, and
I could with certainty identify Girkeny, relatively about
200 feet high, with the locality marked on Petherick’s
map.</p>

<p>It afforded me much amusement to watch the natives
at their ordinary occupations in their pent-up dwellings,
and my portfolio was enriched by the drawings of many
of the household utensils, as well as of the personal ornaments
which the Mittoo women possess in great abundance.
These women are the most frightful that ever yet I had
seen, and the horrible manner in which they mutilate their
lips contributes a great deal to increase their repulsiveness.
Elsewhere this practice is generally confined to the women,
but here the men were similarly disfigured, and in Gahdy’s
village I was visited by a man from whose upper lip there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
hung a pendant of polished quartz more than two inches
long.</p>

<p>Just behind the village we came once more upon the
Wohko, which had here more perfectly assumed the aspect
of a river, being forty feet in width. It had now entered
upon the wide low-lying steppe which extends to the
western shores of the Rohl. We were nearly two hours
in crossing this tract, which was densely covered with grass
so high that, although in my litter I was six feet above the
ground, I had to raise myself to catch sight of the adjacent
mountains.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice how all the rivers that I visited in
this region, such as the Dyoor, the Paongo, the Tondy, the
Roah, and the Rohl, of which the course was almost directly
from south to north, in spite of the slight diminution of the
velocity of the earth’s rotation in these low latitudes of
6° or 8°, follow that law, exemplified in all rivers flowing
northwards, and which is dependent on the rate of rotation of
the earth. The course of all alike was nearly coincident with
the eastern edge of the uniform steppes that covered the
districts subject to their inundations. Along the western
shore of the Dyoor and Paongo the steppes in many places
could not be crossed in much less than an hour, whilst those
on the east could be traversed in little more than ten
minutes. In the same way it takes forty minutes to cross
the western flats on the Tondy near Koolongo, but those
on the opposite bank are easily passed in a sixth of the
time. Here, too, upon the Rohl there are no flats at all
upon the right-hand shore, but the river for some distance
washes past a steepish bank on which lies Ghattas’s Seriba
Awoory. This bank is formed by the slope of the Girkeny,
only about two leagues away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS NAMES OF THE ROHL.</div>

<p>The Rohl contains a much larger volume of water than
the Tondy, and near Awoory its bed divides into several
branches, which in the winter are separated by sandbanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
of considerable height. In the higher parts some stagnant
pools remain, which, as they evaporate, fill the lowland with
swampy humour. On the 17th of December I found the
width of the river to be seventy feet; its depth was only
about two feet and a half, but it was overhung by sandy
banks twenty feet high, which were covered with reeds; its
current moved at the moderate rate of about a hundred
feet a minute. The river must offer an imposing sight in
the height of the rainy season, when the plains are entirely
under water; it must, then, apparently rival the Dyoor,
although it does not contain more than a third of the
quantity of water. Marked on existing maps under the
name of Rohl, it is called by the Dinka the Nam-Rohl, <i>i. e.</i>,
the river of the “Rohl,” which is a tribe of the Dinka
people. The Mittoo, the Madi, and other tribes along its
course give it the name of Yahlo, whilst among the Bongo
it is known as the Dyollebe. This is a fresh instance of
what may be found throughout Africa, where the names
of rivers, towns, and chiefs continually recur, and where
Ronga and Mundo are almost as common as Columbus,
Franklin, and Jackson in North America. The term Kaddo
or Kodda, which appears on some maps, seems superfluous,
since in both the Mittoo and Behl dialects the word means
only “a river,” or generally “water.”</p>

<p>At Awoory a reception grander than usual was prepared
for me. From my elevated position I could distinguish
that the ant-hills were covered with black heads and that
hundreds of inquisitive natives had collected to gratify their
curiosity about me. As I entered the Seriba, fifty men
were drawn up before the gate, under orders to honour me
by firing a salute. Something of a feeling of misgiving
quivered through me, and it was a relief to recollect that
I was up in the air, and so comparatively safe from the
shots that were to be fired on the ground.</p>

<p>The natives around Awoory are called Sohfy, and are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
same as the Rohl, who dwell further east. Their language
in some respects resembles those of the Mittoo and the
Bongo, although there are points in which it differs materially
from both. In appearance and habits, the Sohfy
bear a close affinity to the Mittoo. The three mountains
to the north of Awoory are also inhabited by the Sohfy;
Girkeny, the loftiest of these, is about three leagues distant,
and consists of a bright mass of gneiss, which descends
abruptly towards the south in precipices 200 feet apart.
Petherick’s route in 1863, between Aweel and Yirri, lay
across this mountain. Nearer the Seriba is a little hill,
with its villages of Nyeddy, Yei, and Madoory, all of which
are tributary to Ghattas.</p>

<p>About a day’s journey to the north-east there rises a lofty
table-land, upon which the name of Khartoom has been
conferred by the natives, in order to denote its importance
and impregnability as a stronghold. Its inhabitants are
respected by the people of the Seriba for their bravery
in war, and are particularly renowned for their skill in
archery: although they have been repeatedly attacked,
the aggressors, ever unsuccessful, have been obliged to
retreat with a large number of killed and wounded. A few
weeks previously the population of this Mount Khartoom
had attempted to surprise the Seriba, which most probably
would not have escaped entire destruction, if the garrison
of the neighbouring Seriba of the Poncets had not opportunely
come to its relief.</p>

<p>The Nubians apply the general term of Dyoor to all the
tribes on the Rohl to the south of the Dinka territory,
although the tribes themselves, having nothing in common
either in language, origin, or customs with the Dyoor of the
west (a Shillook tribe), repudiate the definition. The designation
was adopted from the Dinka, who thus distinguish all
tribes that do not devote themselves to cattle-breeding.
Petherick was in error when he imagined that the Dyoor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
country known to him in his earlier travels extended so far as
to include the Rohl: he would have escaped his misapprehension
if he had only noted down a few of the characteristic
idioms of their language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MY FOOT INFLAMED.</div>

<p>Whilst I was in Awoory my foot became so much worse
that for two days I was almost entirely incapacitated. Externally
there was only a slight spot on the sole of the foot,
but the entire limb had swollen with inflammation. I had
every reason to fear an outbreak of guinea-worm, and therefore
resigned myself to the cheerless prospect of being
invalided for several weeks. Unable to carry out my intended
trip to the attractive mountains of the neighbourhood,
I had no alternative but to submit to my disappointment,
and, without accomplishing my hopes, I was compelled to
bid farewell to Awoory. For six days I had been confined
to my litter, and meanwhile all search for plants, all the
enticements of the chase, and all investigation of the implements
peculiar to the villages had to be given up. Enthroned
again on the heads of four sturdy negroes, I proceeded
on my way. Through my position, my range of
vision was somewhat enlarged, so that I had a little compensation
for my helplessness in a more extensive prospect
over the pleasant country. Pain, too, was subsiding, and no
longer engrossed my care. The bright sky above, the still
solitude of the steppes around, the mild air of the tropical
winter, and the unwonted ease of my mode of progress, all
combined to lull me into gentle reverie. The slight rustle
made by the footsteps of the bearers among the yielding
stalks was the only sound that broke my silent contemplations,
and I could almost imagine that I was in a light boat,
being driven by an invisible power across the waves of a
sea of grass.</p>

<p>Until we passed the Rohl the road lay in a <abbr title="south south-east">S.S.E.</abbr> direction,
close along its right-hand bank. Inland, the country
appeared to ascend in gently-rising terraces, but the character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
of the vegetation continued entirely unaltered, the bush-forest
being composed of trees and shrubs of the same kind
that I had observed ever since we had set foot upon the red
soil. At the place of our transit the stream was undivided;
but, although it was 200 feet in breadth, the water was little
more than knee-deep. The numbers of fish were quite surprising,
and our negroes amused themselves by darting with
their arrows at the swarms of little perch, never failing to
make good their aim.</p>

<p>On the opposite bank we entered the territory of another
small but distinct tribe called the Lehssy, whose dialect differs
from both Mittoo and Sohfy. Its narrow limits extend for a
few leagues to the east of the river as far as Kirmo, which
was one of the places visited by Petherick. Beyond again
are the settlements of the Bohfy, in whose territory, a day’s
journey to the east of Mvolo, Agahd maintains a Seriba, which
is situated on the Ayi, a river which, according to Petherick,
contains less water than the Rohl and joins the Dyamid
before it enters the Bahr-el-Gebel. To the north of the
Bohfy dwell the Behl, who, together with the Agar and
Sohfy, possess such wealth of cattle as to provoke continual
raids on the part of the owners of the Seribas. Behind the
Behl again, towards the Bahr-el-Gebel, are the Atwol, a
people much feared for their warlike qualities, rendering
the approaches to the Meshera of that river so unsafe that
caravans are often in considerable danger of attack.</p>

<p>After crossing the Rohl we proceeded a mile or two to
the <abbr title="south east">S.E.</abbr>, and arrived at Poncet’s Seriba in Mvolo. The
character of the scenery had now entirely changed, and large
blocks of granite, at one time in solid cubes, at another in
pointed obelisks, started from the ground. On the north of
the Seriba, and a little above the place where we forded the
river in coming from Awoory, these rocky projections caused
the stream to fall into rapids, which, on a reduced scale,
bore a resemblance to a cataract of the Nile. This chain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
scattered rocks, which runs across the country from west to
east, has been mentioned by Petherick (‘Travels in Africa,’
<abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>) as extending to the south of the village of Dugwara.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BANNER OF ISLAM.</div>

<p>The agent in Mvolo, who had been for many years in the
service of the brothers Poncet, received me most courteously.
As I entered within the palisade of the Seriba, a hundred
men saluted me after the fashion of the country, and even
some shots were fired from a small piece of naval artillery that
stood in the gateway. However honoured I might feel by
this polite reception, I could be conscious of nothing but
vexation at the sight of the blood-red banner with its crescent
and extracts from the Koran. I had flattered myself in vain
with the hope that here at least the cheerful waving of
the tricolour—&#8203;often but a mockery—&#8203;would proudly assert the
authority and independence of the Frank. My people had
repeatedly declared that they would on no account follow
under my flag, and I had no means open to me of convincing
them of their error. The unfurling of the Mohammedan
banner over the possessions of a Frenchman is a practical
demonstration of the limited measure of authority which is
really exercised by the Khartoom merchants over their dependents
in the interior. There is not a single Christian in
the settlement, so that the condition of things is not worse
than might reasonably be anticipated. Such, at any rate, is
my opinion, and I do not doubt but that any fellow-countryman
of Poncet’s would either hold his peace or pass a
judgment even sterner than mine.</p>

<p>In all these countries the slave-traffic is a fact tacitly
acknowledged quite as much as the transactions of the minor
speculators on our own exchanges, and the brothers Poncet
had much odium to endure from being held responsible for
the delinquencies of their subordinates in this respect. These
accusations, combined with the difficulty of maintaining a
proper control over the conduct of their people, made them
hesitate to increase the number of their settlements; their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
insignificant profits, moreover, did not allow them to stand
against the competition of the neighbouring companies,
who shrunk from no means, however unlawful, for enriching
themselves. At length the brothers Poncet had become
weary of the illegitimate proceedings that went on covertly
in defiance of their authority, so that a year previously they
had disposed of their establishments to the Egyptian Government,
stipulating for a period of three years for a payment
of a percentage on the entire produce of ivory at the current
rate of interest. Such were the circumstances under which
the last European firm withdrew from the ivory trade, which
had really been originated and established in the countries
of the Upper Nile by Europeans alone. The Egyptian
Government had looked forward to the monopoly of the
ivory traffic as so likely to be lucrative that they paid a
large sum for its purchase.</p>

<p>Mvolo was practically the nearest point to the region
which was most productive of ivory, and there was a direct
route from the Rohl to the Monbuttoo which avoided the
hostile territory of the Niam-niam. Latterly, the Poncets
had sent out two expeditions in the year instead of one, and
had thus doubled their previous annual profits through
having resources which were not available to any other establishment.
But, in spite of everything, the authorities at
Khartoom must have advised the Government very badly,
for almost immediately after the discharge of the grant
allowed to the Poncets the settlement passed into other
hands, and Ghattas junior obtained for himself and for his
heirs the whole of the productive territory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SLAVE DEALING.</div>

<p>Many may think that a resolution of the Government to
monopolise the ivory trade in this district would augur well
for the future, and that the results would inevitably tend
towards a reform of the existing club-law, but it is really
very doubtful whether such a change would benefit the poor
oppressed natives. It is true that by a larger outlay of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
capital than the Khartoom merchants can afford the profits
might be considerably increased, and many sources of produce
yet undiscovered might be brought to light; but, as I have
said before, there can never be ensured a proper representative
effectually to secure the interests of the Viceroy.
All these enterprises are more or less involved in the slave
trade, and a military occupation could not be thought of,
because only Nubians can endure the climate, and Nubians
would never submit to a regular discipline. Of the ineradicable
propensity to slave-dealing which has always shown
itself in every Government official, be he Turk or Egyptian,
I will say nothing; but I may venture to observe that
neither a regular system of taxation nor the suppression of
the slave trade in the Upper Nile countries is possible until
Egypt shall have made good its footing in Darfoor, that great
nucleus of the Central African slave traffic, which has hitherto
been a place of refuge for all the criminals in the Egyptian
Soudan, and which affords a continual loophole of retreat for
every outlaw of Khartoom. The threat so often heard in the
quarrels of the people, “I will murder you, and escape to
Darfoor,” is a striking illustration of the estimate in which
the district is held.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Mvolo call themselves Lehssy, and in
many particulars of their habits they resemble the Mittoo
and Bongo. In the huts I frequently observed some singular
wooden figures, the Penates of the establishment, which had
been erected to the memory of a departed wife. Petherick
describes the graves near Kirmo as adorned with forked
boughs, and bits of wood carved into the shape of horns,
exactly as I noticed them on the graves of the Bongo.</p>

<p>The district produces plenty of corn, and with its ample
opportunities for hunting and fishing supports a tolerably
large population, which has every appearance of being well
fed. The Lehssy generally are of a medium height, but I
came across individuals of a strength of build such as I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
nowhere else except among the Niam-niam. I was also struck
by the frequent occurrence of feet and hands disproportionately
large. Dongolo, the native overseer of Mvolo, was,
on account of his stoutness, called “bermeel,” a barrel; and
another of the inhabitants was nicknamed “elephant-foot.”</p>

<p>Distinct, in some respects, from what I had already seen
was this district of Mvolo. Far as the eye could reach, there
extended a wide grassy plain, broken by huge stones of
fantastic outline and by thickets or single trees. Graceful
fan-palms waved above the groves, and the autumn tints
gave a rich colouring to the scenery, every rock, with its
covering of creepers, being a picture in itself. In the north
could be seen the three mountains near Awoory, like
purple peaks in the pale azure of the horizon. In the far
distance the country had the deep blue of an Italian sky,
mellowed as it came nearer into peculiar tints of grey
and golden brown; whilst close to the foreground all was
bright with the varied hues of foliage, red, yellow, and olive-green
alternating with the freshness of the sprouting shrubs,
the Indian red of the ant-hills, and the silvery grey of the
jutting rocks.</p>

 <p class="caption">PONCET’S SERIBA IN MVOLO.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The Seriba, like its environs, was unique of its kind. The
formidable appearance of the confused pile-work would have
spoilt the night’s rest of any one who had a very sensitive
imagination. Something like a picture I remember of the
Antiquary’s dream, only without the sea, did the complication
of huts stand out against the tall blocks of granite
from which the fan-palms started like proud columns. The
huts themselves, on their platform of clay, were like paper
cones on a flat table. In front was the great farmyard, with
its hundreds of cattle under the charge of Dinka servants.
These neatherds erect for themselves crooked awnings on
equally crooked piles, and sit huddled up on a soft bed of
ashes round the ever-glowing dungheaps, inhaling with
delight their favourite fumes. These pile-works undergo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
many modifications in design, and have been imitated from
the strongholds made by the natives when they were still
masters of the land. The principal use of these structures is
to afford places of refuge from hostile attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROCK-RABBITS.</div>

<p>Quite in keeping with the fantastic scenery and eccentric
architecture is the peculiarity of the rock-rabbits that dwell
among the crevices of the gneiss. Immediately after sunset,
or before sunrise, they can be seen everywhere, squatting
like marmots at the entrance to their holes, into which, at
the approach of danger, they dart with wonderful snorts and
grunts. The noise they make has caused the Nubians to bestow
upon them the general name of “kako.” There is, however, a
great variety of species, hardly distinguishable from each
other, scattered throughout the Nile countries, every district
seeming to present its own special representative of the race.
Not only are they found in the mountains of Abyssinia and
of Upper Sennaar, but they inhabit those isolated mounds
and hills which give its peculiar character to the landscape
in Southern Kordofan and the province of Taka. Again,
they appear in the mountains of the Bayooda steppes, and
play a prominent part in Southern Africa; whilst other species
are found in Arabia, in the Sinai peninsula, and in the Syrian
mountains. Those that I saw in Mvolo nearly correspond
with the Abyssinian species depicted by Bruce. They appear
to feed chiefly on the bark of trees, although they occasionally
devour young shoots and grass.</p>

<p>Abdoo, the controller of Mvolo, was half a naturalist: as a
huntsman he had done service under many Europeans, and
had acquired a reputation for being a skilful stuffer of birds.
He drew my particular attention to the good sport afforded
by the rock-rabbits, as they crept about in tempting proximity
to the gate of the Seriba. At the same time, he asked if I
could account for the wonderful way in which the animals
managed to clamber up and down smooth rocks that were
almost perpendicular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t tell,” he said, “how it is, but when you have shot
one of the creatures, and catch hold of it, it sticks to the
rock with its feet, in its death struggles, as though it had
grown there.”</p>

<p>The under part of the foot is dark and elastic as india-rubber,
and has several deeply-indented cushions.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This arrangement,
which no other mammalia or warm-blooded animals
seem to possess, enables the creature, by opening and closing
the centre cleft, to throw off part of its weight and to gain a
firm hold upon the smooth surface of the stone. The toes
are nothing but pads of horny skin, without regular nails,
the hind foot alone being furnished, on the inner toe, with
one claw, which is sharply compressed. For some time I
could not at all comprehend how, with such a plump foot,
the rock-rabbit could climb so safely over precipitous walls of
granite, or even along the polished branches of the little trees
in the ravines; but the mystery was solved when I tried to
pick up an animal which I myself had wounded. The granite
was as smooth as pavement, and yet, when I seized the creature
by the neck, it clung like birdlime to the ground, and
required some force before it could be removed.</p>

<p>Although many other species of rock-rabbits or rock-badgers
have been observed by scientific travellers, and
although the animals take a conspicuous place in the fauna
of Southern Africa, yet I have never come across any mention
of this interesting circumstance. My observations may be
discredited, but I have endeavoured to render them as accurately
as possible, in the hope that future travellers will give
further attention to the subject.</p>

<p>The largest specimens that I killed were females with
young, and they measured about ten inches in length. They
were remarkably like wild rabbits, of a grey tint; the males
being much lighter, and having a sharply-defined white stripe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
running about two inches along the middle of the back.
The females of this species produce two perfectly-developed
offspring at one birth. The flesh is like that of a common
rabbit, and quite as much requires an artificial dressing to
make it palatable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANIMALS AROUND MVOLO.</div>

<p>Other interesting animals find their habitats among the
rocks of Mvolo. The pretty little tan-coloured squirrels
(<i lang="la">Sciurus leucumbrinus</i>), with two white stripes on either side,
of a kind which is often seen on the steppes of Nubia, are
here very abundant. There are also swarms of agamas,
nodding their orange-coloured heads; the movements of
these creatures are anxiously watched by the rock-rabbits,
which first utter a note of alarm, and then retreat as nimbly
as marmots to their holes, from which they never venture far
away. Not unfrequently have I waited half-an-hour before
their heads have appeared again.</p>

<p>The inevitable Guinea-fowl, of course, was to be found
running through the grass, also a kind of francolin,
the cocks with tails erect, like little bantams. As my
good entertainment in the Seriba made me independent
of the chase for my sustenance, I only killed a few specimens
of this pretty bird. Francolins, which abound in
other parts of Africa, are very rare throughout the district
of the Gazelle. On the third day after my arrival in Mvolo,
I was once more on my feet and able to take an excursion
to some rapids about half a league to the north-east.
The river divides into three branches, and rushes impetuously
over a bed chequered with blocks of granite. Two of
the larger islands were covered with dense bush-woods, and a
charming hedge of borassus-palm lined the banks. The
main stream passes in equal parts through the northern and
southern arms. The first of these forms a precipitous fall of
fifty feet, and, wildly foaming, dashes into the hollow among
the rocks—&#8203;the entire descent of the river at these rapids
being at least a hundred feet. The river makes a bend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
round the Seriba, and a quarter of a league to the east, above
the falls, it is once more flowing in its ordinary bed, which is
a hundred feet wide. The smooth blocks of stone were as
clean as marble, and the water between was as clear as crystal;
the fan-palms and luxuriant bushes spread a cooling shade
over the pools, and everything conspired to form a spot that
might be consecrated to the wood-nymphs and to the deities
of the streams. It was a place most tempting for a bath—&#8203;a
pleasure from which I had been long debarred. The noxious
properties of the waters which I had hitherto visited, as well
as the dread of fever, had obliged me to forego all such
pastimes; but now I thought I might indulge without fear of
evil consequences. Fish are here so abundant, that whoever
bathes is liable to find himself molested by their bites.</p>

<p>I rambled about the woods on the slopes of the opposite
valley, and made many an interesting discovery. In great
luxuriance grew a remarkable cucumber (<i lang="la">Cucumis Tinneanus</i>),
which is covered by curious and long appendages. Throughout
the district of Mvolo a shrub, which has already been
naturalised in our conservatories under the name of <i lang="la">Tinnea
æthiopica</i>, is particularly plentiful; its wood is used by the
Nubians for pipe-stems. Its boughs, like those of the weeping-willow,
trail to the ground. I gazed with silent emotion
on a plant which seemed to mourn the fate of the brave
traveller by whom, with her tender appreciation of the beauties
of nature, it had formerly been delineated.</p>

<p>At a short distance to the north was pointed out to me the
village of Dugwara, where the natives, as we could hear,
were performing on their nogara.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUGWARA.</div>

<p>I had now reached a point at which my route, for the first
time since I left the Meshera of the Bahr-el-Ghazal, came in
contact with localities whose position is pretty well determined.
Mvolo itself had never been actually visited by its former
owners, but in 1859 Jules Poncet, during the course of his extensive
elephant hunts, had crossed the Rohl somewhere below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
this spot.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The route of the British Consul, J. Petherick,
in 1863, lay along the opposite bank of the Rohl, and
through Dugwara. My own surveys, corresponding as they
did with other routes which had preceded my own, offered
very satisfactory results; they agreed very accurately in
establishing the position which had been assigned to the
Meshera on Arrowsmith’s map<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of Petherick’s travels between
1858 and 1863, so that I had occasion hardly at all to shift
the geographical position of Dugwara. On all earlier maps
the Meshera was invariably marked too, far to the west, and
the Gazelle was carried half a degree beyond its actual length.
The time I occupied, both on my outward and homeward
journey, in the navigation of the river, allowed me ample
opportunity to verify the correctness of these calculations of
my own. I do not know what materials Arrowsmith had at
command to authorize him in making the fortunate amendment;
Petherick certainly did not agree with the alterations,
and, according to his computation, the longitude of this
section of his route on the Rohl would have been twenty
miles farther eastwards than on Arrowsmith’s map—&#8203;a position
which, for various reasons, must be improbable.</p>

<p>I had to undergo many little discomforts before leaving
this interesting region. The black soldiers and slaves belonging
to the Seriba thought that, because I was a white man, I
must be the actual brother of the owner, and accordingly
they came to me with all kinds of grievances. Contrary to
the Controller’s orders, a number of Niam-niam soldiers insisted
on following me everywhere, and I was obliged to remonstrate
with them rather sharply, to make them understand
that I could not permit them to join my people, and that my
retinue was large enough already. The female slaves betook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
themselves for refuge to my hut, bringing their complaints
of the rough usage they received from their angry owners, but
which it was only too probable they deserved for their faithlessness.
The Nubians, on their part, were loud in demanding
judgment from me as to their claims on some or other
of these runaway women. I can only say that I was very
glad to make my escape, and to find myself afresh upon my
journey to the west. I was accompanied by a small herd of
cows, calves, and sheep—&#8203;a present from the controller, who,
moreover, forced an excellent donkey upon my acceptance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RIVER WOHKO.</div>

<p>After a stiff march of seven leagues and a-half, through a
district with few watering-places, and little interest beyond
occasional clumps of the lofty kobbo-tree,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> we were once more
in the territory of the Mittoo, and had reached one of Poncet’s
smaller Seribas, called Legby. There was a second Seriba,
named Nyoli, about three leagues to the south-east, which I
did not visit, as its inhabitants were all busied with a grand
<i lang="fr">battue</i> for elands. These Seribas in the Mittoo country had only
been founded in the previous year—&#8203;they were on the direct
road to the Monbuttoo, and had been intentionally pushed
forward towards the territory of the Madi, in order to ensure
advantageous quarters for elephant-hunting. The greater
part of this region, which previously had been a sort of
No-man’s-land, had been recently appropriated to himself by
a successful <i lang="fr">coup</i> of the enterprising Aboo Sammat. From
Legby to Ngahma was another five and one-third leagues.
The road descended, in a <abbr title="west north-west">W.N.W.</abbr> direction, straight down
to the Wohko, which we now crossed for the fourth time. We
had also to ford two other of the rivulets that traverse the
country, which is a good deal broken by hills and eminences.
The ground had been quite cleared by the burning of the
steppe, and although there had been no rain, a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
perennial plants were sprouting up and covering the bare
surface of the soil with their variegated bloom. Many
of the trees, such as the <i lang="la">Combreta</i> and <i lang="la">Butyrosperma</i>, of
which the flowers appear before the foliage, were in full
blossom. Two especially attracted my attention, because
they entirely fail in more northern regions—&#8203;these were the
<i lang="la">Xeropetalum</i>, with its beautiful bright-red flowers, not unlike
mallows, and the <i lang="la">Stereospermum</i>, which bore grotesque
bunches of bloom, resembling red thimbles. They were
both in their full beauty, and to some extent reminded me
of the floral luxuriance of the Abyssinian highlands.</p>

<p>While in Ngahma, I heard that Aboo Sammat, with his
entire fighting force, had withdrawn from Sabby, for the purpose
of inspecting his numerous Seribas in the south. It
was his first year of possession, and he had gone to feel his
way, preparatory to the taxation of the country. Meanwhile,
all provisions had been exhausted in Sabby, and if I had
ventured to return thither, it would have been at the risk of
being starved. I therefore myself resolved to pursue my
course in a southerly direction, in order to cast in my lot
with Aboo Sammat, until the time drew near for our expedition
to the Niam-niam country. The first halting-place at
which we arrived, after a march of seven leagues, was the
little Seriba Karo, in the Madi district. The road passed
to the <abbr title="south south-east">S.S.E.</abbr> by a small mound of granite, of which the
sterile flats were inhabited by rock-rabbits; we then advanced
over granite flats until we reached a spot where an extensive
table-land lay open to the south. Once again we crossed the
Wohko, and proceeded along its right bank. The river here
has all the characteristics of a periodical stream, and was now
standing in lagoon-like basins. The width of the stony bed,
and the deep holes washed in the huge blocks of granite,
which are covered to a considerable height with the mossy
<i lang="la">Podostemmonea</i>, are proofs of the abundance and violence of
the water in the height of the rainy season. Looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
<abbr title="west south-west">W.S.W.</abbr>, I was greatly surprised by the unexpected sight of
some elevated rocky peaks. Amongst them, and about four
leagues distant, was the point called Wohba, near Deraggo,
which I afterwards visited. This isolated range extends as
far as the Wohko, and there terminates in a ridge 80 to
100 feet in height. Near Karo the stream forms a defile
40 to 50 feet deep, enclosed by regular hills. The banks,
which were very steep, were concealed by the impenetrable
shade of magnificent trees (<i lang="la">Hexalobus</i>), reminding me very
much of the true chestnut.</p>

<p>The Mittoo display a remarkable talent for music, and
construct a great variety of instruments. The most important
of these is a lyre with a sounding-board, not unlike the
robaba used by the people of Nubia. The soldiers in all
the Seribas manifest their African origin by the zeal with
which in their leisure they practise the musical art. I
noticed one of the Madi with a bamboo flute of quite an
European pattern, and at my request he played what was
really a very pretty air, which must have cost him considerable
time and trouble to learn, so perfect were the separate
modulations: when the Nubians heard him they paid him
the compliment of saying that he played as well as any Frank
musician in Alexandria.</p>

<p>From Karo I went on still southwards for three leagues to
Reggo, another small Seriba belonging to Poncet’s company,
and where the elephant-hunters were quartered. The road
thither led chiefly through cultivated fields that had been
planted with Penicillaria. I also for the first time observed
the culture of the sweet potato (<i lang="la">Batatas</i>), a favourite food
of the Niam-niam. This had a singularly sweet taste, and a
purplish rind, which occasionally deviated into white; the
largest tubers of this in the Madi country never exceed the
thickness of a finger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECENT SCARCITY OF ELEPHANTS.</div>

<p>The Poncets had founded settlements in this part of the
country in order to hold their own against the wide incursions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
which Aboo Sammat was making from his territory in
the same direction. The company laid claim to the sole
right of ranging the district, a demand which was only consistent
with their original interest in the ivory produce. The
hunters are called “Sayadeen,” because they are armed with
huge rifles, which have been gradually introduced into the
country from Khartoom. Only a few days previously they
had killed two elephants, which represented a whole year’s
success. In former years the Poncets had commanded the
expeditions in person, and then a corps of these hunters
would in a single year secure as much ivory as would equal
the largest quantity now gathered from the aggregate of the
Niam-niam lands. Although the period of which I speak was
not more than fourteen years ago, these large collections
have become completely things of the past. In the present
Seriba district, it is now expected to make a journey of some
days before there is any likelihood of catching sight of an
elephant at all; the wary beasts, too, appear instinctively to
know the regions in which they can be safe. They live to a
great age, and I do not doubt but that all the oldest representatives
of the elephant community have been at some
time or other attacked by man, and that many have been
actually under fire. In the Dinka country there are places
such as I have already mentioned, in the woods of the Alwady
tribe, where elephants may be seen during the rainy
season. When I asked the Khartoomers why they did not go
and get the ivory themselves, they always replied that such
hunting would be a sorry failure, and that while they were
shooting the elephants the natives would be shooting <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>In Reggo the soldiers were fond of breeding dogs, and the
Seriba literally swarmed with the fat pups of the Niam-niam
breed. I found, moreover, that the people managed to do a
little quiet business for themselves by bartering dogs for
slaves to the Mittoo. Dog’s flesh, too, they enjoyed as much
as the Niam-niam, and the price given for an animal affords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
a proof of the relish they have for the dainty; the teeth
form a favourite ornament for necklaces and stomachers.</p>

<p>The first of January, 1870, appeared, beginning a new
link in the unbroken chain of time. It was the second New
Year that I had commenced in Central Africa, and although
for me the day passed quietly and with no rejoicing, yet I
was filled with thoughts of
gratitude that I had been
spared so long. Although
one cloud and another might
appear to loom in the uncertain
future, yet the confidence
I felt in my acclimatisation
enabled me with
good courage to proceed
upon my wanderings.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<br>
 <img src="images/i_394.jpg"
 alt="Goggo">
 <p class="caption">Goggo, a Mittoo-Madi Chief.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The next place that we
reached was Kurragera, the
most southern point of Aboo
Sammat’s newly-acquired
territory. The march had
occupied about five hours,
and on our way we had for
the sixth time crossed the
Wohko. Previously we had
halted in the village of one
of the Madi elders, who bore
the melodious name of Kaffulukkoo;
I had also the
honour of an introduction
to another chief, called Goggo,
of whom I was able to
secure a portrait. His imposing peruke was not of his own
hair, nor indeed was it hair at all, but consisted of an
artificial tissue of woven threads, which were soaked with
yellow ochre and reeking with grease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KURRAGERA.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
Kurragera’s Seriba, like Aboo Sammat’s other settlements,
had been entirely cleared of its soldiers, and only the local
overseer of the Madi remained to look after the corn-stores.
Inside the palisade were piled thousands of the bearers’ loads,
each neatly packed into a circular bundle, and protected by
the simple and effectual coverings made by the natives from
leaves and straw. These packages contained a preliminary
portion of the corn-stores. Almost every product of the soil
that I have described in Chapter VI. was here to be seen,
and in addition were the sweet potatoes cultivated by the
Madi.</p>

<p>Aboo Sammat at this time, with his whole available fighting
force, was encamped on the Wohko about three leagues
to the south. With the help of 250 soldiers, and more than
300 Bongo and Mittoo bearers, he had put the entire country
in the south and south-east, from beyond the Rohl nearly
as far as the frontiers of the so-called Makkarakkah, under
contribution. The tribes in the more immediate neighbourhood
were the Madi-Kaya, the Abbakah, and Loobah, which
manifestly occupied the same district to which, in 1863,
Petherick’s agent Awat made an expedition. Many chiefs
submitted voluntarily to the taxation; others remained hostile
for a period, but afterwards surrendered all their stores
to the enemy <i lang="fr">à discrétion</i>. The region was so productive
that the number of bearers did not nearly suffice to carry
away the goods that had been seized. The enterprise was
accomplished without any loss of blood.</p>

<p>I was compelled to stay for some days in Kurragera to
await Aboo Sammat’s return, and began to get somewhat
weary, as amongst the flora I could find little that was suitable
for my collection; I had besides used up all the pencils
I had brought with me, and was obliged to write with hen’s
blood. Meanwhile, as in Awoory and Ngahma, I continued
my study of the Mittoo language, and took a great deal
of pains to unravel the intricacies of the Madi method of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
counting, to which I shall have another occasion to refer
hereafter.</p>

<p>The butter-trees were now in full bloom. The milky juice
that exudes from the stems of these trees reminds one of
gutta-percha, which is a secretion of a species of the same
order of plants (<i lang="la">Sapotaceæ</i>). I often saw the children making
balls with the lumps of caoutchouc, which served as universal
playthings. In 1861, Franz Binder, the Transylvanian,
formerly a merchant in Khartoom, brought a hundredweight
of this india-rubber to Vienna, but although the material
turned out very well in a technical point of view, the cost of
its transport was too great for it ever to become an important
article in the commerce of these lands.</p>

<p>On the 7th of January, Aboo Sammat, with the greater
number of his soldiers and bearers, returned to the Seriba.
He wished to display his authority in a way that should
make an impression upon me, and therefore set apart an
entire day for festivities on a large scale. His people were
divided according to their tribes into groups of 500, and
each of these had to execute war-dances worthy of their
commander. Aboo Sammat himself seemed ubiquitous; in a
way that no other Nubian would have done without fancying
himself degraded, he arrayed himself like a savage, and at
one time with lance and shield, at another with bow and
arrow, danced indefatigably at intervals from morning till
night at the head of the several groups; he was a veritable
Nyare-Goio, <i>i.e.</i>, master of the ceremonies; here he was
dancing as a Bongo, there as a Mittoo; then he appeared in
the coloured skin apron of the Niam-niam, and next in the
costume of a Monbuttoo: he was at home everywhere, and
had no difficulty in obtaining all the necessary changes of
apparel. Several of the Bongo of Sabby exhibited a talent
for theatrical representations, and to the great delight of the
Nubians they enacted the scene of how Aboo Sammat surprised
and thrashed the Mukhtar Shereefee; they improvised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
a recitative accompanied by corresponding action, the purport
of which was to tell how Mukhtar was hit with a stick, and
tumbled into the straw hedge crying like a Deloo-buck,
“ba mi oah!” (alas! alas!). Then followed the refrain, “Madrislalla,
illalla, illalla.” Between the parts there was an
incessant firing; the guns were loaded with whole handfuls
of powder, so that it was several minutes before the clouds
of smoke rolled away from the groups of dancers. The continual
noise and dust tired me far more than the longest
day’s march I had ever undertaken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPEECH OF THE KENOOSIAN.</div>

<p>On the following day the Kenoosian convoked an assembly
of the newly-subjugated chiefs of the Madi, and in a long
speech impressed upon them their obligations. I was a
witness of the characteristic scene, and as the interpreter
freely translated sentence by sentence to the negroes, I did
not lose a word of Mohammed’s oration. With terrible
threats and imprecations he began by depicting in the
blackest colours the frightful punishments that awaited them
if they should disobey his orders, while at the same time he
plumed himself upon his magnanimity.</p>

<p>“Look you!” he said; “I don’t want your wives and children,
nor do I intend to take your corn, but you must attend
to the transport of my provisions; and I insist that there
shall be no delay, or else the people in the Seriba will
starve. You, Kuraggera, must go to your villages, and
gather together old and young, men and women: get all the
boys who can carry anything, and all the girls who bring
water from the brook, and you must order them one and all
to be here early to-morrow; every one of them will have to
convey the corn to Deraggo; the bales are of all sizes, and
each may carry in proportion to his strength. But mark
you this: if one of the bearers runs away, or if he throws
down his load, I will tear out your eyes; or if a package is
stolen, I will have your head.” And here Mohammed lifted
a huge weapon like the sword of an ancient German knight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
and brandished it rapidly over the head of the Madi chieftain.
Then turning to another, he proceeded: “And I have
something to say to you, Kaffulukkoo; I know that Poncet’s
people have been here lately, and have carried off two elephants;
now how did they contrive to find them? Bribed
you were, bribed so that you sent messengers to inform them
where the elephants might be found. And you, Goggo, why
do you permit such proceedings in your district? Now
listen: if Poncet’s people come back, you must shoot them;
this must not happen again, or you shall pay for it with your
life; and if any one of you takes ivory to a strange Seriba, I
will have him burnt alive. Now, I think you understand
pretty well what you ought to do. But I have something
else to say, just to caution you in case you may have any
intention of injuring my people. Perhaps, as a Turk may be
walking alone, the negroes may creep into the grass, and
shoot him with their arrows: what of that? Rats may bury
themselves in the ground, and frogs and crabs may hide in
their holes, but there is a way, you know, to find them out;
snakes may creep about in the straw, but to that we can set
fire. Or, perhaps, you will try to burn the steppes over our
heads: never mind, I can light a fire too, and you shall pay
dearly for your treachery. Do as you did before, and run
away to the caves at Deraggo, and I will shoot you there with
shitata (cayenne pepper) from my elephant rifle, and you will
soon be glad enough, half choked and stupefied, to come out
again and beg for mercy. Or, supposing the negroes try and
poison the shallow khor, and any Turks drink that water
and die—&#8203;don’t be expecting to fly away like birds, or to
escape my vengeance!” And much more there was in the
same strain.</p>

<p>I had sent my cattle from Ngahma direct to Sabby, and,
after laying in a sufficient stock of provisions, I prepared to
return as soon as I could to my head-quarters, in order to
have time to complete the necessary arrangements for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
campaign in the Niam-niam countries. Before leaving
Kurragera, I witnessed another amusing scene in Aboo
Sammat’s endeavours to make the chiefs understand the
number of bearers he required. Like most other people of
Africa, the Madi can only count up to ten, everything above
that number having to be denominated by gestures. At last
some bundles of reeds were tied together in tens, and then
the negro, although he could not express the number, comprehended
perfectly what was required of him. Kurragera
was obliged to furnish 1530 bearers, and being asked whether
he understood, made an affirmative gesture, took the immense
bundle of reeds under his arm, and walked off gravely to his
village. We moved on through the day in company with an
enormous train of 2000 bearers of both sexes and of every
age. Keeping on continually in a northerly direction, after
a march of eight leagues we reached the Seriba Deraggo.
The Deraggo mountains were visible several leagues distant
to the north, and afforded some desirable stations for verifying
my route. By the side of one of the Roah tributaries,
called Gooloo, which, however, we did not cross, we halted
for a while, and I employed the interval in shooting guinea-fowl,
ordinary poultry in this district being somewhat scarce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DERAGGO.</div>

<p>For the first time since I had quitted Egypt, I spent the
night in Deraggo without my bedding: the servant who had
the charge of it had left it behind in Kurragera. On all my
tours, I never failed in being extremely careful not to omit
anything that without material expense could contribute to
my health and comfort. I had learnt enough to know that
the more the traveller contrives to spare himself exhaustion
from fatigue, the more he will be able ultimately to perform,
and the greater will be his security against the baneful influences
of the climate. A perfect, or even reliable, acclimatisation
is not to be thought of until after some years’ experience,
and any attempt to hasten it by rash exposure, or by
unnecessary hardship, is quite unavailing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span></p>

<p>I spent one day in a visit to the neighbouring mountains,
which, lying about a league to the east of the Seriba,
extended for about three leagues to the north-east. The
loftiest and most southerly peak is called Wohba, and is
about 500 feet high: it contains some remarkable caves,
which I had not time to visit; they were the same referred
to by Aboo Sammat when he threatened to drive out the
Madi with pepper-dust, a hint which might be taken by any
future general who may desire to smoke out the unhappy
Bedouins from the caves of Algeria. I contented myself with
mounting an eminence about 300 feet high, called Yongah.
The western horizon and the mountains of Awoory were unfortunately
obscured by a dense smoke from the burning of the
steppe; but the little hills between Ngahma and Karo were
distinctly visible. I also noticed in the <abbr title="west south-west">W.S.W.</abbr> a mountain
known as Gere, which I afterwards saw again when returning
from the Niam-niam countries, as I was passing along the
basin of the Lehssy. The chain of Deraggo is formed of a
bright-coloured gneiss. A valley broke in near the spot
which I explored, and along the entrance the Madi had dug
a row of pits forty feet deep for the purpose of catching elephants.
Hither, from a wide circuit, they hunt the animals,
which, hastily rushing into the valley, fall headlong into
the trenches which have been artfully concealed.</p>

<p>The Seriba Deraggo was situated in the eastern part of a
valley gently sloping towards the mountains. From the
depth of this depression there issued an important brook,
whose bed at this season contained a series of huge pools.
We now again turned westwards towards the Roah, in order
that I might visit Kuddoo, the last of Aboo Sammat’s
Seribas, which lies exactly south of Dokkuttoo, and thirty
miles higher up the river. We were obliged to make a wide
<i lang="fr">détour</i> to avoid the mountains, and, after a stiff march for
five leagues in a <abbr title="west north-west">W.N.W.</abbr> direction, we at length reached our
destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RIVER ROAH.</div>

<p>The Roah flows close by Kuddoo in a deep basin enclosed
with forest, and describes a semicircle about the Seriba. The
river was now from thirty to fifty feet wide; in the rainy
season it is as much as fifteen feet deep, whilst in the winter
its depth rarely exceeds four or five feet. The channel of
the river was here entirely overarched with verdure; in some
places the lofty trees starting from the dense woods met
across the water, and formed bowers of foliage, whilst the
fallen stems below made natural bridges. Very feeble were
the rays of light that penetrated to the surface of the water,
and the long creepers trailed from the overhanging branches.
The force of the current caught the pendants, and made the
tree-tops bend and the leaves all rustle as though moved by
the hands of spirits. Large monkeys found congenial habitation
in the branches, the river vegetation offering many of
the fruits on which they can subsist. At times the beauty
and abundance of the blossoms surpassed anything that I had
seen. Pre-eminent in splendour were the brilliant <i lang="la">Combreta</i>:
the masses of bloom gleamed like torches amid the
dark green of the thickets, whilst the golden sheen of the
fruit intensified the marked contrast of the tints. Any
attempt to give a detailed account of the beauties of Africa
is entirely unavailing, and once again I refrain from wearying
the reader with any further repetition of my admiration.</p>

<p>Leaving Kuddoo, we marched for eight leagues near the
left bank of the Roah, and across the numerous little water-courses
that intersect the region, and flow down to the river
on the right. At Degbe we re-entered the road along which
we had travelled on our outward trip, and, passing through
Dokkuttoo, we did not again quit our previous route all the
way to Sabby. As we approached Geegyee, the spot notorious
for the rapacity of the lion, my people betrayed an
anxiety still greater than upon their journey thither, for in
Dokkuttoo the intelligence had reached us that some lions
had been again seen on the previous day, and that several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
travellers who had come across them in their march had only
escaped by climbing up into the trees. This was a circumstance
that painted itself upon my fancy in such entertaining
details, that I could not resist the desire to see it acted out
for my own amusement. Accordingly, when we had reached
the densest part of the formidable forest, at a spot where the
pathways were most crooked and intricate, I bellowed out in
the most despairing accents I could command, the cry of
“A lion! a lion!” In an instant the bearers had flung
down their burdens, and my brave Nubians scampered off to
the nearest tree. Nimbly as sailors up the rigging of a
foundering ship, did they clamber high into the boughs. I
enjoyed my laugh as I made them see what brave fellows
they were.</p>

<p>We here saw in all directions the recent traces of numbers
of elephants, which must have crossed our path in many
places during the previous night. Our last bivouac was
made on the banks of the Tudyee, where we feasted on the
flesh of two hartebeests, brought down from among a number
that had been feeding on the tender foliage of the underwood.
On the last day but one of the march, I had more
exertion than on any other of the twenty-four through which
the excursion had lasted; without once sitting down, I passed
the entire day in hunting and walking.</p>

<p>On the 15th of January I once more re-entered the hospitable
huts of Sabby, and was welcomed by the servants I had
left behind, and almost overpowered by the joyful caresses of
my dogs. This tour to the east had altogether extended
over 210 miles, and I had thoroughly explored the territory
of a people who had hitherto been almost unknown, even by
name. I will now take a retrospect of the country I had
just left, and give a brief summary of my observations on its
political condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MITTOO.</div>

<p>In default of a national designation for a group of tribes
speaking almost the same dialect, and whose distinctive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
qualities appear mainly in their slight differences of apparel,
I should prefer to follow the example of the Khartoomers,
and call these people simply Mittoo; this name, however,
only really belongs to the most northerly of the group, who
call themselves Mittoo, or Mattoo, and there are four other
tribes who consider themselves equally distinct and independent,
viz., the Madi,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the Madi-Kaya, the Abbakah, and
the Loobah. Their collective country lies between the rivers
Roah and Rohl, and for the most part is situated between
lat. 5° and 6° <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> Towards the north it stretches far as the
territories of the Dinka tribes of the Rohl and Agar; on
the south it is bounded by the eastern extremity of the
Niam-niam, where the name of Makkarakkah has already
been adopted in our maps. But Makkarakkah and Kakkarakkah
is a designation which the Mittoo use for the Niam-niam
taken in the gross, and not the name of any single
tribe. Out of their own mouth, whenever I referred to the
soil upon which I was standing, I had every proof that the
Mittoo call their land “Moro,” a name which Petherick on
his map has attributed to the entire district between lat.
4° 30´ and 6° N., which extends eastwards from the Rohl to
the Ayi.</p>

<p>All the Mittoo tribes are able to converse with each other,
as their languages present only such minor differences of
dialect as might be supposed would arise from their independent
political position; the Niam-niam, on the other hand,
with just the same plurality of tribes, preserve a uniformity
of language which admits of scarcely any variety. The
Mittoo dialects in some of their sounds resemble that of the
Bongo, but taken as a whole, like all the distinctive languages
of the larger nations of the Gazelle, the Mittoo and the
Bongo have very little in common. As far as regards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
customs, dress, and household appliances, it must be admitted
that the Mittoo tribes most nearly resemble the Bongo, and
it almost might seem as if, in the history of their development,
they formed a transition between them and the Niam-niam.</p>

<p>The subjection of the Mittoo to the Khartoomers must not
be dated earlier than the year preceding my visit. Although
the country in a limited sense had to a certain extent been
partitioned amongst the arbitrary and advancing companies
of the Upper Nile, and notwithstanding that its inhabitants
had been in places reduced to a condition of vassalage
similar to that under which the Dyoor and Bongo had been
smarting for the last ten years, yet the entire subjugation of
the southern tribes, the Loobah and Abbakah in particular,
might still be described as incomplete. The Abbakah
hitherto have been only occasionally subject to the incursions
of slave-catchers and corn-stealers, and therefore they have
neither the advantages nor the disadvantages, whatever they
may be, of actual vassals.</p>

<p>In the scale of humanity all the Mittoo tribes are decidedly
inferior to the Bongo: they are distinguished from them by
a darker complexion, and by a bodily frame less adapted to
sustain exertion or fatigue. During my visit to the Niam-niam
countries, I had many opportunities of seeing large
bodies of bearers of both races, side by side, and was then
able to institute comparisons between the two. The Bongo
vied with each other in their powers of endurance, and would
subsist for a length of time upon mere roots without any
perceptible change in their appearance, whilst the Mittoo
under the same ordeal would waste almost to skeletons, and
in a very short time would abandon all attempt at work.
Even in their own homes I hardly ever saw them with
the strongly-built frames of the sturdy Bongo. Nearly
all the Mittoo who were employed as bearers were afflicted
with the guinea-worm. An undesirable prerogative is this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
that the race have gained, that they should nurture such
a thorn in the flesh; for the guinea-worm is far from universal,
and makes selections as to what diversities of human
nature it shall choose to patronise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERTILITY OF MITTOO COUNTRY.</div>

<p>I failed to obtain any satisfactory explanation of this
debility of the Mittoo; their land is very productive, they are
diligent agriculturists, and they cultivate many a variety of
cereals and tuberous plants, as well as of oily and leguminous
fruits. On account of its fertility the land requires but
little labour in its culture, and throughout its extent displays
a productiveness which is only found for any continuance at
rare intervals in the other countries that I visited. It is
especially noticeable between lat. 5° and 5° 30´ N., in the
districts on the upper Roah and Wohko, which are liberal
stores for the sterile Nubian settlements on either hand.
The district of the Mbomo, which is adjacent to that of the
Nganye of the Niam-niam, between the rivers Lehssy and
Roah, is also pre-eminent among its neighbours for its
extensive growth of maize.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
The Mittoo breed the same domestic animals as the Bongo,
viz., goats, dogs, and poultry; they possess no cattle, and
are on that account ranked by the Dinka under the contemptuous
designation of “Dyoor,” which is intended to be
synonymous with savages. They estimate the dog, however,
in a very different way from the Bongo, and by their fondness
for its flesh show that they are not many grades above the
cannibal. Bernardin de S. Pierre, in his ‘Études de la
Nature,’ gives it as his opinion that to eat dog’s flesh is
the first step towards cannibalism; and certainly, when I
enumerate to myself the peoples whom I visited who actually,
more or less, devoured human flesh, and find that among
them dogs were invariably considered a delicacy, I cannot
but believe that there is some truth in the hypothesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUTILATION OF LIPS.</div>

<p>The whole group of the Mittoo exhibits peculiarities by
which it may be distinguished from its neighbours. The
external adornment of the body, the costume, the ornaments,
the mutilations which individuals undergo—&#8203;in short, the
general fashions—&#8203;have all a distinctive character of their own.
The most remarkable of their habits is the revolting, because
unnatural, manner in which the women pierce and distort
their lips; they seem to vie with each other in their mutilations,
and their vanity in this respect I believe surpasses
anything that may be found throughout Africa. Not satisfied
with piercing the lower lip, they drag out the upper lip as
well for the sake of symmetry.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> To the observations I have
made before about all African tribes that in their attire they
endeavour to imitate some part of the animal creation, I may
add that they seem to show a special preference for copying
any individual species for which they have a particular
reverence. In this way it frequently happens that their
superstition indirectly influences the habits of their daily
life, and that their animal-worship finds expression in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
dress. It is, however, difficult to find anything in nature
collateral with the adornment of the Mittoo women; and it
surpasses all effort to understand what ideal they can have in
their imagination when they extend their lips into broad
bills. If our supposition be correct, the Mittoo fashion perhaps
only indicates a partiality for the spoonbills and the shovellers
with which these ladies may have some spiritual affinity.
The projections of the iron-clad lips are of service to give
effect to an outbreak of anger, for by means of them the
women can snap like an owl or a stork, or almost as well as
the <i lang="la">Balæniceps Rex</i>.</p>

<p>Circular plates nearly as large as a crown piece, made
variously of quartz, of ivory, or of horn, are inserted into the
lips that have been stretched by the growth of years, and
these often rest in a position that is all but horizontal; and
when the women want to drink they have to elevate the upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
lip with their fingers, and to pour the draught into their
mouths.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Similar in shape is the decoration which is worn by the
women of Maganya; but though it is round, it is a ring and
not a flat plate; it is called a “pelele,” and has no other object
than to expand the upper lip. Some of the Mittoo women,
especially the Loobah, not content with the circle or the
ring, force a cone of polished quartz through the lips as
though they had borrowed an idea from the rhinoceros.
This fashion of using quartz belemnites of more than two
inches long is in some instances adopted by the men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MITTOO GARMENTS.</div>

<p>The women of the Madi correspond in their outward garb
with the Mittoo in general; they make use of a short
garment of mixed leaves and grass like the Bongo. The
men adopt the same kind of skin covering for their loins as
the Bongo, but they have one decoration which seems peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
to themselves; they wear in front something after the style
of the “rahad” of the Soudan or the “isimene”
of the Kaffirs—&#8203;a short appendage made of
straps of leather, ornamented by rings and
scraps of iron; but it is so narrow that it
has almost the look of a cat-o’-nine-tails.
There are others who buckle on to their loins
a triangular skin which has every variety of
rings and iron knick-knacks fastened round
its edge.</p>

<p>Occasionally there were to be seen some broad
girdles covered with a profusion of cowries, such
as the Niam-niam were said to wear; but
hitherto the Madi were the only people I had
met with who retained any value for cowries,
which for some time had ceased to be held in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
much repute in the Gazelle district. The mode of wearing
these conchylia was to split off their convex
backs and to fasten them on so as
to display only the white orifices.</p>

<p>Like the northern Bongo the Mittoo
disdain devoting their attention to the
decoration of their hair: men and women
alike wear it quite short. The portrait
of Goggo has already furnished a representation
of one of their elaborate
perukes.</p>

<p>The plucking out of the eyelashes
and the eyebrows is quite an ordinary
proceeding among the women. The men
have coverings for their head the same as the Niam-niam.
The accompanying portrait of Ngahma shows such an article
of headgear, suggesting the comparison either of a Russian
coachman’s hat, or of the cap of a mandarin. They are very
fond likewise of fixing a number of iron spikes to a plate
which they fasten behind the head, and to these they attach
strings of beads and tufts of hair. The Madi make also a
sort of cap rather prettily ornamented with coloured beads
and which fits the head tight like a skull-cap.</p>

<p>It is only among the men that tattooing is practised on a
large scale, the lines usually radiating from the belly in the
direction of the shoulders like the buttons on certain uniforms;
the women merely have a couple of parallel rows of
dotted lines upon the forehead. The variety is very great of
the ornaments which they construct out of iron and copper,
consisting of bells, drops, small axes and anchors, diminutive
rings, and platters, and trinkets of every sort. All the
women wear a host of rings in their ears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MITTOO ORNAMENTS.</div>

<p>These tribes have the same liking for iron chains as the
Niam-niam and the Monbuttoo. Whatever they attach to
their bodies they attach by chains; and they are very inventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
in their designs for armlets and rings for the ankles.
The armlets very often have a projecting rim, which is provided
with a number of spikes or teeth, which apparently
have no other object than to make a single combat as effective
as possible.</p>

<p>Even amongst these uncultured children of nature, human
pride crops up amongst the fetters of fashion, which indeed
are fetters in the worst sense of the word; for fashion in the
distant wilds of Africa tortures and harasses poor humanity
as much as in the great prison of civilisation. As a mark of
their wealth, and for the purpose of asserting their station in
life, both sexes of the Mittoo wear chains of iron as thick as
their fingers, and of these very often four at a time are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
noticed on the neck of the same individual. Necklaces of
leather are not unfrequently worn strong enough to bind a
lion; these impart to the head that rigidity of attitude given
by the high cravats at which we wonder so much when we
look at the portraits of a past generation. When the magnates
of the people, arrayed in this massive style, and reeking
with oily fat, swagger about with sovereign contempt amongst
their fellow mortals, they are only as grand as the slimy
diplomatists, solemn and stiff, who strut along without vouchsafing
to unlock one secret from their wary lips. These
necklaces are fixtures; they are fastened so permanently in
their place that only death, decay, or decapitation can remove
them. I was never fortunate enough to see the mysterious
operation by which these circles were welded on, but I know
that when the rings are soldered to the arms and ankles,
fillets of wood are inserted below the metal to protect the
flesh from injury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MITTOO MUSIC.</div>

<p>Amongst the many particulars in which the Mittoo are
inferior to the Bongo, it may be noticed that their huts
are not only smaller, but that they are very indifferently
built. Many of them could be covered by a crinoline of
lavish proportions. In their musical instruments, however,
and in their capabilities for instrumental performances, they
are far superior to any of their neighbours. Instead of the
great “manyinyee,” or wooden trumpet of the Bongo, they
make use of long gourd flasks with holes in the side. They
have also a stringed instrument which may be described as
something between a lyre and a mandolin; five strings are
stretched across a bridge which is formed from the large
shell of the Anodont mussel; the sounding board is quadrangular,
covered with skin, with a circular sound-hole at each
corner. The instrument altogether is extremely like the
“robaba” of the Nubians, and constitutes one of many evidences
which might be adduced that the present inhabitants
of the Nile Valley have some real affinity with the tribes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
the most central parts of Africa. The flute is made quite
on the European principle, and is most expertly
handled by the Madi, who bestow
much attention on mastering particular pieces.
Small signal-horns made with three apertures
are in general use amongst the tribes of the
district; but the slim trumpet called “dongorah”
is peculiar to the Mittoo; it is about
eighteen inches long, and resembles the
“mburah” of the Bongo. Music is in high
estimation amongst the tribes which compose
this group, and it may be said of them
that they alone have any genuine appreciation
of melody, negro music in general being mere recitative
and alliteration. I once heard a chorus of a hundred
Mittoo singing together; there were men and women, old and
young, and they kept admirable time, succeeding in gradual
cadence to procure some very effective variations of a well-sustained
air.</p>

<p>The implements in general differed very little from the
industrial contrivances of the Bongo. Their iron-work is
rougher and clumsier; but they take a great deal of pains in
forming their arrow-tips, having scores of devices for shaping
the barbs. One of their ordinary utensils is a crescent-cut
ladle with a long handle for stirring their soup.</p>

<p>Graves, for the most part are seen like those of the Bongo;
they consist of a heap of stones supported by stakes, on
which is placed the flask from which the deceased was accustomed
to drink; both Mittoo and Bongo too, as might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
conjectured, have the same method of disposing of their dead,
and erect the carved wood penates which have been already
mentioned.</p>

<p>The use of the bow and arrow gives the Mittoo a certain
warlike superiority over the Dinka, and among their neighbours
they are considered to surpass the Bongo in their
dexterity in archery. Their bows are four feet long, and of
an ordinary form. Like the Monbuttoo, who have shorter
bows, they use wooden arrows which are about three feet in
length. The heads of these arrows reach to the middle of
the length. The Mittoo despise the cumbrous protection
of a shield, but they are careful to keep a liberal supply of
spears.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Three</span> months had thus elapsed in almost uninterrupted
wanderings, but I found on my return to Sabby that I could
spare only a short reprieve for recruiting. Previous to starting
on the laborious expedition to the Niam-niam, to which under
the guidance of my protector I had pledged myself, there
remained only a fortnight. A score of packages had to be
fastened up, many a trunk had to be arranged, clothes had
to be provided, implements of many sorts to be secured,
ammunition and arms to be put in readiness for the projected
excursion into a hostile territory, where we proposed
to pursue our way for six months to come. In addition to
this provision for the future, I had to make good the arrears
in my diary, to get through all my correspondence for the
current year, and to provide for the remittance of my valuables
to distant Europe. All this had to be accomplished in
the space of fourteen days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span></p>

<p>Nor could domestic demands afford to be overlooked.
My household required a vigilant supervision. The mere
labour of washing our clothes was considerable, although the
accumulation of two months’ wear was by no means extensive.
In order to perform the laundry work, it was necessary
to send to the river, a league and a half distant, where
the things could be rinsed out, dried, and bleached. On the
evening before our departure for what we called “the world’s
end,” my four-legged body-guard was suddenly enlarged by
eight charming little pups of the splendid Shillook breed.
Of my Nubian servants, Hussein was the oldest and the most
experienced, and to him I entrusted the responsibility of
conveying in safety the newly-born animals, together with
my correspondence and all my collections, back to Ghattas’s
Seriba in Dyoor-land, which I still deemed my head-quarters.
The worthy fellow thus had the advantage of exchanging
the prospect of a roving life among the Niam-nian for the
friendly life of the Seriba, where, in the society of his countrymen,
he might pass his time in playing upon the robaba, in
mastering the intricacies of the game of mungala, or, while
the gourd-shells of merissa went merrily round, in joining in
the chorus, rendered with a fine nasal twang, of “Derderoah,
derderoah el yum, derderoah, derdereh, ginyatohm.”</p>

<p>By the 29th of January, 1870, every preparation had been
so far advanced that the bulk of the caravan was set in
motion. Mohammed Aboo Sammat himself proposed to join
the party in about a fortnight, as he was compelled to go
into the Mittoo district to secure some additional bearers.
My own retinue consisted of four Nubian servants, and three
negroes who were engaged as interpreters, one of them being
a Bongo, the other two genuine Niam-niam; besides these,
there was a number of Bongo bearers, which at first was
about thirty, but in the course of our progress was increased
to forty. The whole of these were supplied to me at the
sole expense of Mohammed, whose hospitality I had now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
been receiving for three months, and continued to enjoy to
the end of our excursion; not only throughout the period of
eight months did he entertain me and all my party whilst
we were in his settlements, but he entered most readily into
all my wishes, and whenever I desired to explore any outlying
parts he would always lend me the protection of a
portion of his armed force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOHAMMED ABOO SAMMAT.</div>

<p>Never before had any European traveller in Central Africa
such advantageous conditions for pursuing his investigations;
never hitherto in the heart of an unknown land had there
been anything like the same number of bearers at his disposal,
and that, too, in a region where the sole means of
transport is on the heads of the natives. All the museums—&#8203;particularly
those which are appropriated to botany—&#8203;which
have been enriched in any way by my journeyings are
indebted to Aboo Sammat for not a few of their novelties.
Solely because I was supported by him did I succeed in
pushing my way to the Upper Shary, more than 800 miles
from Khartoom, thus opening fresh districts to geographical
knowledge and establishing the existence of some enigmatical
people.</p>

<p>Everything, moreover, that Mohammed did was suggested
by his own free-will. No compulsion of government was put
upon him, no inducements on my part were held out, and,
what is more, no thought of compensation for his outlay on
myself or my party ever entered his mind. The purest
benevolence manifestly prompted him—&#8203;the high virtue of
hospitality in its noblest sense. Whoever is actuated by the
spirit of adventure to penetrate into the heart of Africa, so
as to make good his footing amongst four different peoples,
is undoubtedly a man of energy; although he may not be
spurred on by any scientific purpose, and may simply be
gratifying a desire to visit lands that are strange and to
enjoy sights that are rare, yet he must have succeeded in
vanquishing the thoughts which suggest that there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
place like home, and which represent it as the merest folly
to sacrifice domestic ease for the fatigues, troubles, and
privations which are inseparable from the life of a wanderer.</p>

<p>Our caravan was joined on its way by a company of
Ghattas’s from Dangadduloo, conducted by a stout Dinka,
whose acquaintance I had already made at the Seriba where
he resided. His party consisted of 500 bearers and 120
soldiers, and they contemplated, in conjunction with a part
of Aboo Sammat’s people, undertaking an expedition into
the ivory district of Keefa. That district was shut out from
Ghattas’s by the fact of the road towards it being the property
of Aboo Sammat: according to a convention entered
into by the Nubians, a caravan of one company was not to
traverse a region appropriated by another, unless an alliance
for that purpose was made between the two. As the result
of this compact, it had come to pass that no less than fifteen
different roads, corresponding to the same number of different
merchant houses in Khartoom, branched out towards the
south and west from the localities of the Seribas into the
remotest lands of the Niam-niam.</p>

<p>Wherever two of these roadways intersect, a serious collision
between the parties concerned is almost certain to
ensue. Any conductor of an expedition is sure to endeavour
to get the monopoly of all the ivory into his own hands.
The various native chieftains are prohibited from disposing
of their produce to any other agent than himself—&#8203;a demand
which is enforced by violence—&#8203;and rival companies are intimidated
by threats of action for trespass; in fact, no pains
are spared to assert a right as vigorously as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MITTOO BEARERS.</div>

<p>An agreement had now been made according to which the
leader of Ghattas’s caravan was to accompany Aboo Sammat’s
expedition as far as his establishments in the Niam-niam
lands, and afterwards was to be allowed the protection of
a military detachment to proceed towards the west, Aboo
Sammat himself having resolved to carry on his own main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
body in the direction of the south. The bearers of the
Ghattas party from the east were all Mittoo, a tribe that is
of much weaker frame and less capable of sustaining fatigue
than the Bongo, so that by the time that they had reached
Sabby, although it was only about four days’ march, they
had already a considerable number of invalids. Aboo Sammat’s
intention this year was to make his first experiment
with the Mittoo from the territories he had recently gained,
and to try to employ them as bearers in this enterprise
among the Niam-niam. To be a bearer is a service which
demands a kind of apprenticeship, and no one without
practice is fitted for the continual strain and endurance
which it requires. The representations, moreover, which had
been made to these inexperienced Mittoo, both about the
nature of the country they would have to traverse and
the cannibal propensities of the people with whom they
would be brought in contact, acted so powerfully upon them
that it was only under compulsion that they could be made
to enter upon the service at all. While, therefore, the Bongo
bearers were to be relied upon, and looked forward blithely
to any fatigues that might be before them, the Mittoo had
to be scrupulously watched, and by night to be carefully
secured within the bounds of the palisade to prevent their
effecting an escape. On the very evening before we started
from Sabby a number of them ventured upon a combination
to revolt, and, in fact, got free into the open country. By
the assistance of the Bongo they were captured after an
hour’s hard chase, brought back into the Seriba, placed under
closer guardianship, and for a punishment were made to wear
all night the yoke of the <a id="chg4"></a>“shaba,” which is ordinarily placed
on the necks of slaves.</p>

<p>Swelling the numbers of our caravans there was a whole
troop of women and female slaves, and a crowd of negro lads
who followed the soldiers to carry their equipments. There
was in addition a large herd of cattle which the Ghattas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
party had plundered from the Dinka, and which they drove
with them to maintain themselves when they came to enter
upon the desolation of the desert. Aboo Sammat, never rich
in cattle, because he did not, in the same way as his neighbours,
indulge in plundering the Dinka, had certainly made
no superfluous provision for the needs of his people; but for
myself there was an abundant supply of calves, sheep, and
goats still remaining from the liberal presents that had
been made me in Mvolo during my excursion to the Rohl.
Whenever an animal was killed, I invariably shared the
meat with the Nubians, and they were always ready to
return the favour as often as they slaughtered any of their
own. My people’s necessities were thus supplied, whilst personally
I was continually provided by Aboo Sammat with
the choicest morsels as long as there was any choice to be
made. But where property fails, even Cæsar must forego
his rights; and days of scarcity did arrive, when for my
servants there was nothing, and for myself there was next to
nothing, to be had.</p>

<p>It will readily be imagined that for a colony of nearly
800 people a start in single file was not effected in a moment:
it was quite midday before I commenced any movement
at all. Several days had to elapse, and no little
patience had to be tried, before things fell into anything like
regularity. Of all men in the world, perhaps the Nubians
are the most disorderly. Method is altogether alien to their
nature; they loathe it after the unshackled freedom they
are accustomed to indulge; they have no idea of any advantages
arising from mutual co-operation, and accordingly
they look upon any approach to order only as a token of
individual bondage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANAGING THE NUBIANS.</div>

<p>Amongst a body of men actuated by such sentiments, any
thought of discipline, according to our ideas, is entirely out
of the question. Only that master can at all hope to succeed
in exercising any authority who understands how to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
upon the weak side of their character. By this means he
may perchance attain what he wants in a way which a Turk,
even by the extremest severity, could never accomplish.
He may prevail, for instance, by slipping in at the right
time an allusion to brotherhood, or by an appeal to honour
and to the value of one’s word; or he may invoke the religious
sentiment by reminding the Nubian of his being a
Mohammedan, “Thou art a Moslem;” or again, by holding
out a bribe, such as a fresh slave or a good payment, he may
reduce a cantankerous spirit to subjection; but whatever is
done has to be effected craftily and with a good deal of
insinuation and gentle coaxing. No one understood all these
artifices better than Aboo Sammat, who was utterly regardless
of all consequences and could behave like a perfect tyrant
as soon as ever he had established a control. On account
of my own position amongst the Nubians I had to renounce
most of these little artifices, but, nevertheless, I had my own
special resources. A piece of wit, brought to bear at the
right place and at the right time, very seldom failed to be of
essential service. Although a capacity for appreciating wit
must in a way be considered local and limited in its compass,
yet it hardly admits of dispute that there is no nation of the
world entirely without its sense of humour. The botanist
Fortune, who made his laborious investigations in China,
has left it upon record that he only succeeded by mother-wit
in gaining access to a people which had previously
resisted every effort towards the least familiar intercourse
with them. A faculty of bantering a little may be of considerable
service to assist the progress of a traveller; and I
may, perhaps, be allowed to relate what follows as an instance
of the mode in which I attempted to proceed, and the
example, perchance, may give a trifling hint to those who
may be disposed to follow in my wake.</p>

<p>I will assume that there was going to be some contention
or other between me and my people, as, for instance, that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
had determined to go to some particular mountain, and they
held it as utterly useless to go and camp in a desert while
they had the chance of staying and enjoying their merissa
among their friends. Very rarely in Egypt do people exchange
a few words with one another without introducing
the term “ya Sheikh” as a mode of allocution. Even a
father talking to his son of a few years old will address him
as “ya Sheikh.” In Nubia the habit is not quite so general,
but is common enough to be familiar and to be entirely
understood. Now, one of my people had once taken umbrage
at the word being addressed to him, and in ill-tempered
<i lang="fr">pique</i> he had repudiated the term, saying “Don’t sheikh
me; I am no sheikh.” I thought to myself that he should
hear of this again; and hear of it again he did.</p>

<p>Some weeks elapsed, and by chance an occasion arose
when we were discussing about a certain mountain, whether
it were too far off or too high for us to ascend. One of
my party was arguing and trying to satisfy the other, who
was our cantankerous friend of old, and happened to
begin one of his appeals to him by saying “ya Sheikh.”
This was my chance; so I cried out, “O don’t sheikh
him. Twice he has himself told me that he is no sheikh; he
is a lout. If he were a sheikh, he would go with us to the
mountain; but, because he is a lout, he likes to stay behind
and sip his beer.” A general laugh of applause followed my
little sally, and the joke was hailed with a round of derision
against the captious booby. This trifling circumstance, perhaps,
may illustrate the mode of dealing which appeared to
answer best, and I hope needs no excuse for the length at
which it is related.</p>

<p>Delay upon delay prevented our making a start, and
Nubian-like we consumed the day in getting ready. When
the caravan did issue from the Seriba, it proceeded, according
to the usage of the country, under the conduct of a
banner carried ahead. The armed force was portioned out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
in three divisions, each of which had its own flag. Aboo
Sammat’s banner was like the Turks’; it had the crescent
and the star upon a red ground: Ghattas, although he was
a Christian, displayed the same symbol of Islam, only red
upon a white ground. At the start, two captains, Ahmed
and Badry, were put in charge. Of these I had already
made the acquaintance of the latter, during my excursion to
the Rohl. Aboo Sammat himself, as I have mentioned, had
arranged, with the third corps, to join the caravan somewhat
later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BANNER OF ISLAM.</div>

<p>At the outset of any expedition, whether it be a movement
to the river, a raid upon the cattle of the Dinka, or an
excursion to the Niam-niam, it is deemed an indispensable
preliminary that a sheep should be offered in sacrifice at the
entrance of the Seriba. When this has been accomplished,
the procession is prepared to start, and the standard-bearer
lowers his flag over the victim, so that the border of it may
just touch the blood, and afterwards there is the usual
muttering of prayers. In truth, the banner of Islam is a
banner of blood. Bloodthirsty are the verses which are
inscribed upon its white texture; a very garland of cruel
fanaticism and stern intolerance is woven in the sentences
from the Koran which, in the name of the merciful God,
declare war against all who deny the faith that there is one
God and that Mohammed is his prophet, and which assert
that his enemies shall perish from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>The sun was already in the zenith when we found our way
to the arid steppes; the heat was scorching, but I enjoyed
having my dogs about me, barking for joy at their liberation
from the confinement of the Seriba. Very memorable to me
is still that day on which I took this first decisive step
towards the attainment of my cherished hopes. I thought of
that moonlight night as I left Khartoom, when upon the
glassy mirror of the White Nile I had kept my vigil of
excited interest, and now here I was making a still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
decisive movement and entering upon a still more important
section of my enterprise. Now, there was nothing to obstruct
me from penetrating to the heart of Africa far as my feet
could carry me; now, as Mohammed said, I could advance to
the “world’s end,” and he would convey me on till even I
should acknowledge that we had gone far enough. But
unfortunately my vision of hope was doomed to be dispelled.
Just at the moment when curiosity was strained to its
highest expectation, at the very time when scientific ardour
was kindled to go on into the very depths of the mysterious
interior, we were compelled to return. Had we only been
enabled to prosecute our journey as far again towards the
south, I do not entertain a doubt but that I should have been
in a condition to solve the problem of the sources of those
three great rivers of the west, the Benwe, the Ogowai, and
the Congo.</p>

<p>Upon the first day’s march we only proceeded a few miles
and camped out beside the little stream Tudyee, of which the
deeply-hollowed bed was divided into two separate arms. In
one of these arms a languid current was passing on, but in
the other, which was perfectly dry, I took my repose for the
remainder of the day, under the shade of a grateful shrubbery
which overhung its recesses. The revelry of a camp
life was not wanting; meat in abundance was boiled, roasted,
and broiled, and the festivity extended far into the night.
As is ever the case on the first encampment, the proximity
to the settlements with their ample provisions enables it to
assume the aspect of a picnic.</p>

<p>The most valuable portion of my luggage was conveyed in
twelve small portmanteaus, carefully covered with hides:
the remnant was carried in chests and baskets. The rolls of
paper were wrapped in sheets of calico, which I had well
soaked in fresh caoutchouc. I continued to experience the
great comfort of having my baggage conveyed by hand, so
that I had access at any stage of our progress to whatever I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
required. It was hardly necessary to keep anything under
lock and key, for nothing could be stolen that would not at
once betray the thief. Everything was therefore open, and
consequently very little time comparatively was lost in
preparing for the daily start. There was only one thing to
be guarded against, and that was the propensity of the
bearers to turn the packages upside down. It was necessary
in this particular to be always jogging the memory of the
Bongo, who would reply “mawah,” (I hear) and so everything
would go safely along, over sloughs and brooks and marshes,
and across the steppes reeking with dew, wherever the leader
might desire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAVELLING COSTUME.</div>

<p>Anxious to reach the village of the Bongo sheikh Ngoly,
we made a prolonged march on the next day. Proceeding
through the most southerly of the districts occupied by the
Bongo, we kept still in the region that belonged to Aboo
Sammat. An hour or more before sunrise, as is usual with
these caravans, a general <i lang="fr">réveil</i> was sounded by drums and
trumpets, and a meal was made on the remains of the previous
night’s feast, as no halt was to be allowed for breakfast. A
collection of plants, however, has to be carefully handled,
and while my people were strapping up the packages, and
the bearers and soldiers were forming their line, I found a
quiet half-hour to prepare myself a cup of tea, and to arrange
all my little matters for travelling. For the European
traveller no article of apparel is better adapted than an old-fashioned
waistcoat, with as many pockets as possible, into
which a watch, a compass, a note-book, a tinder-box with some
matches, and other articles of continual use may be stowed.
A coat of any sort, however light, becomes a burden upon
a walking expedition; about the arms it always uncomfortably
obstructs the perspiration. A strong felt hat with
a broad brim is the best protection for the head; it is
preferable to the Turkish cap, but on account of the
intense power of the rays of the sun it cannot be worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
immediately next the head. It cannot have anything below
it better than the red fez, which never requires to be taken
off; when rest is taken under the shade of some spreading
tree, it is quite sufficient to remove merely the felt hat.</p>

<p>The march was through a pleasant park-like country, and
after crossing a considerable number of fordable rivulets, we
arrived about midday at the huts of Ngoly. At Ngoly, over
a surface of about eight square miles, we found various groves
of the <i lang="la">Terminalia macroptera</i>, having very much the look of
a wood of European oaks. In these regions any continuance
of a single species of tree or plant is very rare, and the bush-forests
are generally remarkable for the great diversity of
species which is found on a limited area. The Terminalia is
to be classed amongst that small number of trees of which
regular groves, in what we call forests, rise to the view. It
grows, as may readily be observed, upon the gentle depressions
of a soil sufficiently rich, but which is yet too dry for
the formation of the tall grass of the steppes, being watered
only by currents which are formed during the rains, and of
which we crossed the remnants during the dry months of
winter. Between lat. 5° and 3° N., in the longitude under
which we were travelling, the equatorial zone of the continual
rainfall decidedly suffers an interruption, and the zenith
altitudes of the sun cannot be said to bear a due proportion
to the largest annual fall of rain.</p>

<p>The forests of the Terminalia are remarkable for the
general deficiency of undergrowth or bushwood which they
exhibit, a circumstance that arises from the general inability
of woody plants to endure so moist a soil. The large proportion
of the trees and shrubs of the country thrive much
better in the rocky regions of the ironstone, and if ever a
grove establishes itself where the ground is wet, it soon gets
as clear of undergrowth as though all had been taken away
by the hand of man, and ere long it assumes quite a northern
aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">VOLUNTEER HUNTSMEN.</div>

<p>The landscape in Africa presents to a large extent examples
of trees which only cast off their foliage fitfully. In
contrast to these, the Terminalia annually throws off all its
leaves as soon as the rains are over, and throughout our
winter months it is perfectly bare. It grows to a height of
about thirty or forty feet, and by its deeply-scored black bark
and the general character of its ramifications, it may be
said to be not unlike the glutinous alder of the north.</p>

<p>I passed the afternoon in a charming wood chasing the
hartebeests (<i lang="la">Antilope caama</i>) which were abundant everywhere
over this attractive hunting-ground. Their leather-coloured
coats stood out in glaring contrast to the dark
tree-stems; but the lack of underwood left our extensive
encampment so thoroughly exposed, that the animals took
alarm betimes, and were difficult to reach. Accordingly
after an hour’s fatigue, I had to content myself (as would
happen again and again) with a number of guinea-fowl,
which were a never-failing and never-palling contribution to
our <i lang="fr">cuisine</i>. On all my hunting excursions I invariably found
myself accompanied by a regular troop of people who made
the chase a matter of great difficulty, but who nevertheless
considered their services indispensable. My own three negroes
carried the portfolios for the plants, and my rifles; but
from the bearers there was always a swarm of volunteers who
came to act as pointers, prompted to their extra exertions,
partly from a desire to get the lion’s share of what might
fall, and partly from that irrepressible love of hunting which
seemed indigenous to their very nature.</p>

<p>As a matter of botanical interest I observed the frequency
with which the wild <i lang="la">Phœnix</i> occurs in the low district all
around Ngoly. Most probably this is the parent-stock of the
date-palm; the time in which its fruit is here ripe is the
month of July.</p>

<p>Up betimes on the morning of our third day’s march, I
took my place at the front of our caravan, close behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
standard-bearer, in the hope of getting near enough to secure
a shot at some hartebeest that might be taken by surprise.
In the woods the animals could be seen in numbers as great
as on the previous evening; they skulked behind the black
stems of the trees, keeping a vigilant look-out, but as soon as
anyone attempted to leave the procession and approach them,
off they were with a bound, and scampering away in a zigzag
career, regained the wilderness.</p>

<p>For a full hour the way proceeded through the wood, and
then we entered a low-lying steppe which brought us to the
running water of the little river Teh or Tee. As we approached
we saw a herd of buffaloes betake themselves to
flight, and, snorting and brandishing their tails, dash into the
stream; these brutes, however, are here as elsewhere quite
easily surprised by an adept. Flowing rather rapidly, the
Teh is between twenty and thirty feet in breadth, and passes
along wooded banks which gave me my first introduction to
the flora of the Niam-niam. The botanical treasures of this
district, I may venture perhaps to call the “bank or gallery
flora,” in contradistinction to that extensive class of vegetation
which predominates over the wide steppes around. Large
<i lang="la">Scitamineæ</i> contribute an essential feature, and there is an
Oncoba which bears upon its leafless wood blossoms that
are conspicuous for their numerous stamens. This Oncoba
is here found in its most northerly abode, but its growth is
wide-spread as far as Benguela.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was little leisure for me to enjoy this
attractive <i lang="fr">entrée</i> to the flora of the land. We had to hurry
on, and passed quickly into a region where the tall unburnt
grass made the route indistinguishable to all but an expert,
and where it was impossible to see more than a few paces in
advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALLEY OF THE MONGOLONGBOH.</div>

<p>By perseverance we reached a bare and extensive rocky
plain developing itself into the depression of a valley along
which the stream of the Mongolongboh cuts its winding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
path. The rock is all composed of red ironstone, very
frequently of that coarse and large-grained quality which
is technically known as roe-stone. These flats of red rock
are common all through the districts south of the great
alluvial territory of the Dinka which is watered by the
Gazelle and its various tributaries. They are often, for
leagues together, level as the surface of a table, scarcely ever
revealing a rift, and very rarely worn away into hollows.
When, however, any of these depressions are found, they
are always sure to be full of most interesting specimens of a
periodic vegetation.</p>

<p>Our next halting-place was elope by the water-side under
the shade of some noble trees, in which a merry troop of
monkeys were frisking. As we arrived before midday, I
had an opportunity of taking a ramble in the neighbourhood.
For some miles round, the region was entirely uninhabited,
and the utmost desolation prevailed. None of the traces of
any previous occupation could be seen—&#8203;none, I mean, of the
peculiar weeds which will survive where there has been any
cultivation; everywhere there was only bushwood and steppe,
except just in the spots where the stone flats were on the
surface or where the ground rose into hills, enclosing the
valley along which the Mongolongboh wound its course.
There was a fine panorama of the vale from the top of the
hills, and many a group of antelopes enlivened the general
stillness of the scene. My attention was arrested by a plant
which was new to me and characteristic of the region; this
was the little <i lang="la">Protea</i>, which occasionally formed complete
hedges, bearing a resemblance to the class of vegetation
which is found in the south of Africa, but which is very
rarely met with in any northern portion of the continent.</p>

<p>Ahmed, the temporary leader of our caravan, had made
arrangements to start again immediately after noon, at the
same time announcing that we could not expect to be able
to reach any place supplied with water at which we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
pass the next night. This statement was quite contrary to
the declaration of those who knew the way, and on the
following day was refuted. Ahmed, however, persisted in
his opinion, and, in his own Nubian fashion, said that he
was ready to be pronounced a liar by any one who could
disprove the truth of what he said. Wranglings of this sort
went on day after day, and occasioned me some disquietude
and misgiving.</p>

<p>A gathering storm compelled us to put forth all our
energies, by way of precaution, to protect the baggage.
The dark clouds rolled towards us, and the encampment
was all bustle and alarm. By good chance, however, the
storm passed on over our heads, and we had only a few
heavy drops of rain. Since the end of last November this
was the first day on which any rain at all had fallen. As
often as we were threatened with wet, and time did not
permit us to erect our tent, I made my baggage as secure
as I could, by piling wood and layers of stone upon it, and
covering the whole with great sheets of waterproof twill.</p>

<p>Long before sunrise on the 1st of February we had
quitted our encampment, hastening our movements through
a fear, which was altogether groundless, of there being a
deficiency of water. Encompassed by hills, we marched
along rising ground, and by the time that the morning
light had dawned, we found ourselves at an elevation of
about 500 feet above the valley of the Mongolongboh, and
with a prospect open before us towards the south, much
more extensive than we had hitherto enjoyed. The ridges
of hills ran from east to west, and the peaks right and left
of the path by which we were proceeding were called by our
leaders Mbala Ngeea. Looking to the south we could see
a thickly-wooded vale several miles across, and beyond this
were two terraces diverging towards the west, which were
made conspicuous by the contrast in their colour. The dark
blue ridges which were more remote in the <abbr title="south south-west">S.S.W.</abbr> were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
pointed out as the district of Nganye, and the residence of
the first Niam-niam chief whom we should have to visit.
Before us in the valley there was visible the low ground of
the Lehssy, which, in the lower part of its course, is called
Doggoroo by the Bongo; whilst only separated from the
Lehssy by a range of little hills, there was still beyond the
broad and fertile valley watered by the Upper Tondy, which
here receives the name of the Ibba. Among the Bongo its
name is simply Bah, i.e. the river, just as the local population
of Baghirmi call the Shary, a further evidence of the
relationship which exists between the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOLIAGE OF KOBBO-TREES.</div>

<p>We now descended from the heights and arrived at the
Mah, of which the flat bed caused a number of broad pools of
water to obstruct our way. This was the water that gave
the lie to Ahmed’s statement. Along undulating terraces
we next reached a wood, which consisted for the most part of
wide stretches of kobbo-trees (<i lang="la">Humboldtia</i>), which gave a light
but welcome shadiness to our path. The height attained
by these <i lang="la">Cæsalpineæ</i> is generally about forty feet. They are
to be admired for their fine feathery foliage, and for the size
of the seed-vessels which hang from the boughs. During
the drought of the winter season, when the herbage was
short, or had altogether perished through the burning of the
steppes, they sent out young sprouts graceful as the main
stem itself, which were a charming ornament to the woods.
The colour of the tender leaves sported from a bright moss-green
to the richest purple, each leaflet being not less than
two feet long. The magnitude of the leaves gives a peculiar
feature to the woods, which flourish freely on the upper
terraces of the district, the steppes in the depressed vale
around being marshy and quite destitute of trees.</p>

<p>Making a fresh ascent, we passed upon our left one of
those insulated elevations of gneiss which are so frequent
in these regions, and which, as they lie scattered and
weather-beaten over the plain, have all the indication of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
being the remains of some upheaving of the hills above the
general level of the ferruginous swamp-ore around. The shape
which these islands of gneiss most generally assume is that of
a spherically-arched mound, here about 200 feet in height;
and of this I saw some thirty examples in different parts during
the course of my wanderings. A group of stately hartebeests
was parading upon the summit, and surveyed from
the distance of half a league the progress of our caravan as
it wound its way along the bushy paths. By midday we
had reached the Lehssy, and camped upon a flat of gneiss
which the waters at their height had washed. At the
present season of the year the stream pursued its course
beneath the soil, but it had left a considerable number of
water-pools, some of them a hundred paces long, and from
forty to fifty feet wide, which, overhung as they were by
shading bushwood, abounded in fish, especially barbel. By
means of small shot I was able to secure a good many of
these; and in a country like this where an agricultural life
necessitates a residence remote from the river-plains, and
where fresh fish is with difficulty preserved on account of
the heat, such a catch is invaluable; it is welcomed as a
dainty, and makes a most desirable change in the wearisome
routine of the daily diet.</p>

<p>The splendid Afzelia-trees which overshadowed the Lehssy
gave an additional charm to this halting-place, which was
abundantly supplied with water that was as bright as it
was refreshing. The level surface of the gneiss answered
the double purpose of couches on which to sleep and tables
on which to eat. Upon the shadowy banks one of the
<i lang="la">Anonaceæ</i>, the Hexalobus, grows extensively, exhibiting its
long tufted flowers, and breathing forth its pungent vanilla-like
aroma; the petals, in colour and appearance, resemble
little fragments of tape-worm, and are quite unlike any other
known plant.</p>

<p>Continually was the repose of night again broken by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
incessant chattering or singing of the Nubians, who ever
chose the night-time for their hilarity, and in consequence
were all day long as sleepy and lazy as they could be. All
at once, when everyone was asleep, they would start up, and
as a freak fire a <i lang="fr">feu de joie</i>, startling the nocturnal silence
by the whistling of their balls. Even the negroes did not
sleep around their fires undisturbed. Under cover of the
night every one took care to look after his own individual
needs, and to enjoy the morsels that he had contrived to
gather in the day-time; and many a tit-bit carefully concealed
from the eyes of others all the day, was secretly
consumed by the hungry fellows in the dead of night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN EXHAUSTED BEARER.</div>

<p>On the following morning I was one of the hindmost of
the caravan, and proceeded in the company of Ahmed, our
guide, and a few stragglers. We had passed two or three
watercourses, overhung with copse wood and now quite dry,
when we came upon a Mittoo bearer, exhausted by his
journey, lying by the wayside. He was a poor withered,
consumptive creature, and seemed as if he were pretty near
his last gasp. The other bearers had taken his burden from
him, and, conscious that he could not carry it farther, had
spoken a few cheering words and left him to his fate. By
a fair day’s walking it was just possible he might regain his
home, provided he could keep clear of the prowling lions on
his way; but lions, it is known, have a remarkable scent for
a poor lone and helpless man. Let a poor fellow be sick
or wounded, and he incurs a double danger. Meanwhile, the
people who were with me were all discussing the matter in
their own way; they could not agree whether the poor
wretch were really ill, or whether he was making pretence,
and not a few of them declared that no sooner would he
have the chance than he would be off homewards as nimbly
as a hare. Ahmed at this point put in his word, and
observed that a day’s journey farther in advance, the man
would never have ventured upon being left behind by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
company, for fear of finding his way to the caldrons of the
Niam-niam. This observation of his immediately turned
the conversation to the subject of the cannibalism of that
people, of which I was far from being convinced.</p>

<p>I mentioned that Piaggia had resided a whole year among
the Niam-niam without witnessing a single instance of the
practice. Ahmed replied that Piaggia had only visited
the district of Tombo, where the people were nothing like
so bad as they were here in the east, and he asserted that
I should only have to wait for a few days before proof strong
enough would be opened to my eyes. He went so far as to
declare, nay, he swore hard and fast, that he knew a case in
which some bearers, who had died from fatigue on the way,
had been buried, and that in the interval of his going and
returning, their graves had been reopened. Naturally I
objected to this statement, that only the day before he had
branded himself as a liar, and that consequently his word
deserved no confidence; he persisted, however, in his affirmation,
and went on to argue that it was not possible that
it was any beast that had disturbed the graves; stones had
been removed to get at the corpses that they wanted.
“Yes,” he added, “and I have myself seen them eat foul
flesh,—&#8203;vile, stinking, putrid flesh;” and as he spoke he made
grimaces so horrid, that they had every sign of being the
expression of a sincere abhorrence. Poor Ahmed! I can
think I see him still upon those rocks, expressing his
emotion by the gestures of his hands. I can even now
hear the vehemence of his oaths. Poor Ahmed I as though
he were to be the very first of victims to his own belief,
within a few weeks he fell in a <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>, his body could not be
found on the scene of conflict, and where should it by any
possibility have gone, except into the stomachs of the Niam-niam?</p>

<p>Farther onwards our progress was very much impeded by
the high masses of dry grass which had escaped destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
when the steppes were burned. In the path, which is a
mere narrow rift in the steppes, made by those in front
forcing themselves through, grass-stems abound so hard
and firm, that they are as unyielding as the stubble of a
sorghum-field, and make a most disagreeable obstruction
in the way. The chain of hills over which we had crossed
the day before constitutes the present boundary between the
hunting-grounds of the Bongo and the Niam-niam. Indications,
however, are not wanting that until a few years ago,
the country quite up to the base of the hills had been
occupied by the Niam-niam; at present the first district
of this people is reached at the farther bank of the Ibba.
As we continued our march, we observed a number of half-burnt
posts belonging to their huts, and every here and
there amidst the grass, there were the remnants of the great
wooden drums, which never fail in any village of this people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BATH IN THE IBBA.</div>

<p>At noon we arrived at the Ibba, as I have said the Upper
Tondy here is named. About a hundred feet in breadth,
but only three feet deep, it offers no difficulty in the way
of being forded. The water was running from east to west
at the rate of sixty feet a minute, and many blocks of gneiss
were lying in the river-bed, which was bounded by gradually
ascending banks. I found some deep water beneath a line
of overhanging trees, and thoroughly enjoyed a refreshing
bath; it was my mishap, however, to experience an inconvenience
which occurred to me again more than once in
the course of my travels. Half-an-hour I had to wait for
my clothes, which had been carried off by the mistake of
one of my servants, and taken to the caravan. In my position
it was impossible to avoid the heat of the sun, and
the skin of an European is too sensitive to endure without
mischief a temperature which at the very least was 80° Fahr.
in the shade, the ordinary heat of the district in a locality
well shaded, but quite open to the influence of the wind.</p>

<p>Upon the southern side of the river were the first cultivated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
lands of the Niam-niam that we had yet seen, and
which at that time were lying fallow. Shortly afterwards
the ground suddenly rose for some hundred feet. The
universal Sorghum is here the prevailing crop, but farther
on it is in a very large degree replaced by Eleusine.</p>

<p>We next found ourselves upon the territory of a tolerably
rich chieftain, named Nganye, who was on very friendly
terms with Aboo Sammat. Meanwhile, for the first mile
or two after we left the river, we observed that all the
inhabitants vacated their abodes. The name of the superintendent
of the district was Peneeo. In all regions like
this, where the greater fear happened to be on the side of
the natives, the same behaviour was repeated, and very often
was accommodating to both parties. In these cases the
people with their wives and children, their dogs and poultry,
their guitars, their baskets, their pots and pans, and all
their household articles, make off to the thickest parts of
the steppes, which have been spared from the fire and
reserved for elephant hunting; there they hide themselves
in an obscurity which only the eye of a bird could penetrate.
It will not rarely happen that they are betrayed simply by
the cackling of their fowls.</p>

<p>Some of Mohammed’s soldiers, who had been sent on in
front, returned and brought us tidings of welcome from
Nganye, whose residence we hoped to reach on the following
day. We found ourselves, however, already very comfortable,
as Peneeo, the chief of the district, or Behnky,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> had likewise,
as Nganye’s representative, paid us his compliments;
he had brought a supply of corn for the bearers, and a lot of
poultry as a present to myself. In his retinue were a number
of men, who, although they were not unlike the score of
Niam-niam that I had seen at Sabby, yet here in their own
home had an appearance singularly wild and warlike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">POPUKKY-GRASS.</div>

<p>With their black poodle crops of hair, and the eccentric
tufts and pigtails on their heads, they afforded a spectacle
which to me was infinitely novel and surprising. Amongst
the hundreds of Bongo and Mittoo, with whom the Dinka
were associated as drovers, these creatures stood out like
beings of another world; here were genuine, unmistakeable
Niam-niam, neither circumcised nor crop-headed, such as
other travellers have seen either in Khartoom or in the
Seribas; here they were, presenting all the features of
wildness which the most vivid Oriental imagination could
conceive; a people of a marked and most distinct nationality,
and <em>that</em> in Africa and amongst Africans is saying
much.</p>

<p>Pursuing our route on the following day, we passed along
a country that was very undulated, and led through many
deeply cut defiles which ran down to the river. For three
leagues we kept making a stiff ascent over fallow land, until
we arrived at the settlement of Nganye. In consequence of
the early rains and that which had fallen in the previous
night, the ground had become quite soft, and a multitude of
those plants which put forth their blossoms before their
leaves had sprouted up. Grass so strong and so thick I
have never elsewhere seen, as what I saw in this region.
Subsequently I penetrated much farther on, and saw the
high grass of the southern districts in the height of the rainy
season, but on returning in the month of June, I could not
suppress my astonishment at the enormous growth which
here the grass attained. The dry stalks, in their height
and thickness like reeds on a river-bank, are intentionally
protected by the natives from destruction when the steppes
are burned: and whenever there seems a chance of driving
up a herd of elephants, the steppe-burning is only partial,
and done in patches. The strongest of these permanent
grasses is a species of panicum which the Niam-niam call
“popukky.” The haulm of this attains a height of fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
feet, and becomes almost as hard as wood, and as thick as
a man’s finger. Cut crosswise its section is not circular, but
a compressed oval, its colour being a bright golden yellow.
At its lower end it is not hollow like a reed, but quite
compact in substance, and if I wanted to make pipe-stems
of it, I was obliged first of all to bore right through its
length. Of this popukky the Niam-niam construct some
very serviceable doors for their huts, and some mats, which
they lay upon the ground and use for beds.</p>

<p>Whenever masses of grass of this nature are set on fire,
the elephants have no possible escape from certain death.
The destruction is carried on by wholesale. Thousands of
huntsmen and drivers are gathered together from far and
wide by means of signals sounded on the huge wooden drums.
Everyone who is capable of bearing arms at all is converted
into a huntsman, just as everyone becomes a soldier when
the national need demands. No resource for escape is left
to the poor brutes. Driven by the flames into masses, they
huddle together young and old, they cover their bodies with
grass, on which they pump water from their trunks as long
as they can, but all in vain. They are ultimately either
suffocated by the clouds of smoke, or overpowered by the
heat, or are so miserably burnt that at last and ere long
they succumb to the cruel fate that has been designed for
them by ungrateful man. The <i lang="fr">coup de grâce</i> may now and
then be given them by the blow of some ready lance, but
too often, as may be seen from the tusks that are bought,
the miserable beasts must have perished in the agonies of a
death by fire. A war of annihilation is this, in which neither
young nor old, neither the female nor the male, is spared,
and in its indiscriminate slaughter it compels us sorrowfully
to ask and answer the question “Cui bono?” No other
reply seems possible but what is given by the handles of our
walking-sticks, our billiard balls, our pianoforte keys, our
combs and our fans, and other unimportant articles of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
kind. No wonder, therefore, if this noble creature, whose
services might be so invaluable to man, should even, perhaps
some time during our own generation, be permitted to rank
in the category of the things that <em>have been</em>, and to be as
extinct as the ure-ox, the sea-cow, or the dodo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT A MBANGA.</div>

<p>Fatiguing enough we found our progress through the
towering grass. The path was narrow, and it was very necessary
to plant one’s foot firmly upon the stalks to avoid
stumbling on the way. At length towards noon we arrived
at the head-quarters of the chieftain, a residence which, in
the language of the country, is called his “mbanga.”</p>

<p>I found myself at once encircled by the natives, who came
streaming in to see for themselves the white man of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
already they had heard so much. It was my own first opportunity
of seeing the Niam-niam in the reality of their natural
life. As became a people with whom hunting is a prominent
feature in their pursuits, they were girded with skins. High
upon their extensively-dressed hair they wore straw-hats
covered with feathers and cowries, and fastened on by means
of long bodkins of iron or copper. Their chocolate-coloured
skin was painted in stripes, like those of the tiger, with the
juice of the Blippo (<i lang="la">Gardenia malleifera</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">COURT OF A NIAM-NIAM POTENTATE.</div>

<p>Whilst I was reposing beneath an awning that had been
put up as a shelter from the sun, the natives bestowed upon
me such a prolonged and decided stare that I had ample
opportunity for transferring a few of their portraits to my
sketch-book.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In the early evening I paid my respects to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
Nganye, the resident prince. His abode consisted of a collection
of huts, some larger than others, which he had
assigned to his body-guard, and to the wives and children of
his closest associates. The mbanga of a prince may be
known at once by the numerous shields that are hung upon
the trees and posts in its vicinity, and by the troop of picked
men, fully equipped, who act as sentinels, and are at hand
night and day to perform any requisite service. Military
expeditions, surprises, conspiracies for murder, are here the
order of the day, but frequently other and better employments
will arise to engage them—&#8203;as, for instance, when the
discovery is announced that a herd of elephants is in
the neighbourhood. Then the signals must be sounded, and
everyone without delay must be summoned, the occurrence
being recognised as of national importance, for there is the
chance of securing many hundredweights of ivory, and perchance
ten times the weight of meat.</p>

<p>The shields are woven in pretty patterns of intermingled
black and white, and are lined with royal leopard-skins.
They are fastened by means of an iron knob on the inner
side to the “trumbash” (an iron missile with three large
projections), and altogether form really a striking sight.</p>

<p>Very modest in its pretensions was the court of this negro
prince, and it had little to distinguish it from the huts of the
ordinary mortals who had their homes around. The huts
were circular, and had conical roofs which were unusually
high and pointed, and were probably constructed to throw
off the rain outside, as well as to allow for the dispersion of
the smoke which was caused by the fire below. Surrounded
by a dozen women, who with some household slaves superintended
the tillage of the royal domain, Nganye had every
appearance of enjoying a peaceful—&#8203;nay, it may be said, an
idyllic—&#8203;existence.</p>

<p>I found him perfectly naked except for a little apron that
he wore. He was sitting on a Monbuttoo stool, quite unarmed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
and with no insignia whatever of his rank. There
were, indeed, some twenty or thirty natives who were armed
and kept guard in the outer court, but apart from this any
pretension to state was entirely wanting. By means of my
two interpreters I contrived to keep up a long conversation
which I found interesting enough. I was made acquainted
without reserve with all the details of Nganye’s family, and
with all the particulars of his home administration. It was
much that I came to him as a friend of Aboo Sammat’s.
Aboo Sammat was to him a friendly neighbour, who brought
to him as his chief an annual contribution of copper, beads,
and stuffs; and the prince in return stored up for Aboo
Sammat’s purchase all the ivory which the year’s exertions
had secured. As regarded my own native land he did not
exhibit the remotest curiosity; concerning the design and
object of my journey no particle of interest betrayed itself in
anything that he said nor in any question that he asked;
and a similar remark may be made with respect to all
the chieftains with whom I happened to be brought in
contact. As everywhere else in Africa, a welcome is here
given by reaching out the right hand; the middle fingers
are joined and jerked together until they snap and crack
again.</p>

<p>Whilst the cannibal magnate and myself were thus in
solemn conference, and were ever regarding one another
with that reverence which befits the representatives of noble
communities, my retinue was being entertained with roast
buffalo meat served up in pretty carved dishes. There was
nothing palatable that could have been placed before me,
and although Nganye, as subsequently Wando and Munza,
accepted food from me, I never did from them. It is extremely
unusual for Nubians and natives to take any meals
in common, not so much from any religious scruple, but
simply because it has never been the custom. In front of
me, however, was placed a great clay vessel with four necks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
full of Niam-niam beer brewed from eleusine, which my
Nubians enjoyed thoroughly as being stronger than anything
they can get in their own country.</p>

<p>I presented Nganye with a great many necklaces of
garnet-beads of the kind which had been prepared for the
East Indian market. My own collection included no sorts
except those which were quite novel in this country, having
been provided not at all for the purpose of merchandise, but
with the express object of making presents. Out of compliment
to me, Nganye always wore my gifts as long as we
remained in his locality, but, in the same way as other chieftains,
he at other times systematically abstained from adorning
himself with any foreign trinkets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECT OF RAIN.</div>

<p>On the night of the 3rd of February some rain again fell,
but it was not heavy enough to penetrate the grass coverings
that we had improvised for our baggage. This was the third
occasion on which we had now had rain, and although the
fall had been very insignificant, in fact scarcely a quarter of
an inch, yet the effect was so great as to be almost magical.
Its influence alike upon the thirsty earth and withered
steppes was very wondrous, and the sprouting stalks of grass
bore ample witness to the invigoration that it brought.</p>

<p>A broad valley, alternately steppe and cultivated land,
spread itself out around the residence of Nganye, and through
its midst there wound a watercourse which now was dry.
Over this we made our way; and mounting the opposite
acclivity, proceeded one league onwards to the west, thus for
the time reversing our previous progress. Black and barren
were the burnt steppes at this season, when the elephant-hunting
was all over, and they were unrelieved as yet by any
vegetation. Literally our feet trod upon the embers of the
burnt grass, very much to the detriment of my own white
costume, and involving a large consumption of my soap that
had been so laboriously procured from oil of sesame, burnt
wood, and oyster-shells. Around the base of the charred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
bushes there were little lines of green where the young
sprouting herbage broke through the earth, and now and
then some opening blossom would give an unexpected beauty
to the scene. It almost seemed as if these early-blooming
children of Flora had been waiting for a few drops of the
rain that they might escape from the womb with the remnant
of the sap which it had yet to give. Upon the general
gloomy aspect of the landscape these rare scattered blooms
of course could make no impression; it was needful to seek
for them, and bend low to find them; they were modest as
the violet which seems to hide itself by the wayside, and yet
has charm enough to detain the passer-by.</p>

<p>A charming walk of two leagues and a half brought us to
a subsidiary holding of Nganye’s, named after its superintendent
Gumba. The villages of the district were abundant
in corn, and afforded too welcome a chance for the hungry
bearers to resist making there their halting-place; the prospect,
moreover, of brimming beer-flasks had its wonted attraction
with the Nubians. The goal was full in view; a little
ridge of hills beckoned hospitably from afar, and immediately
beyond were the broad acres of cultivated land which belonged,
to Gumba.</p>

<p>A region was this which rarely failed to supply charming
halting-places, and we could take our noontide rest in shady
yet breezy positions beneath the spreading trees. The
tamarind, however, which hitherto had thrown over us its
pleasant canopy during our way along the lonely desert, now
failed entirely, and I saw it again no further to the south;
so also Mungo Park’s butter-tree, which had been so prominent
a feature upon the red soil of the Bongo and the
Dyoor, now disappeared completely from the scene; but on
the other hand there were here displayed as much as in the
northern latitudes the Parkia, the Afzelia, the Vitex, the fig,
and the Khaya, whilst with these there were intermingled
many new and striking forms of incomparable beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLOCASIÆ.</div>

<p>The country hereabout was tolerably secure, the Niam-niam
being desirous to secure Aboo Sammat’s friendship in
order to ward off any mischief that might arise from the
dangerous neighbourhood of Sabby. I considered it sufficiently
safe to venture upon a little tour, attended only by
my two Niam-niam servants. Directing my steps to the
hill, I found that it was only like a hundred others, a pile of
brown roe-stone, and apart from the open panorama it
afforded, it possessed no interest at all. All along I gathered
weeds and plants in ever-fresh variety.</p>

<p>Making at length our halt at a hamlet, my two companions
drew my attention to a valuable production of their land.
Underneath one of the granaries, which was supported in the
usual way upon posts, was a great pile of firmly-pressed clay.
On this an old woman was hammering with the pestle belonging
to her mortar, and having knocked a hole, she drew out
some tubers of a kind that I did not recognise. I afterwards
found that it was the Colocasia, which is cultivated very
freely throughout the Niam-niam country, and which when
boiled makes a very excellent vegetable. The thick covering
of clay is put over them not only to keep them moist in the
dry season, but also to defend them from the ravages of rats,
worms, and white ants. Whenever any of the tubers are
required it is only needful to knock a hole through the clay,
which can be plastered up again with a few handfuls of fresh
mud. The same plan is also adopted in the rainy season to
protect the crops from damp and rot; thus clay, everywhere
abundant, is an universal antidote to the violence of nature.</p>

<p>As the darkness came on, our camp was enlivened by the
appearance of the grotesque figure of a singer, who came
with a huge bunch of feathers in his hat, and these, as he
wagged his head to the time of his music, became all entangled
with the braids of his hair. Altogether the head was like
the head of Medusa. These “minne-singers” among the
Niam-niam are known as “nzangah.” They are as sparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
of their voices as a worn-out <i lang="it">prima donna</i>; except for those
close by, it is impossible to hear what they are singing.
Their instrument is the local guitar, the thin jingling of
which accords perfectly well with the nasal humming of the
minstrel’s recitative. The occupation of these nzangah,
however, notwithstanding the general love of the people for
music, would not appear to be held in very high esteem, as
the same designation is applied to those unfortunate women,
friendless and fallen, who are never absent from any community.
Quite contrary to the practice of the neighbouring
tribes, they have nothing to do with boisterous music, and
only use their drums and horns for the purpose of signals.
The minstrelsy of the Niam-niam may be said to have the
character of a lover’s whisper.</p>

<p>Starting again and proceeding to the south, after an
agreeable walk of about three hours, we arrived at the
quarters of Bendo, a brother of Nganye, who had set him in
charge of one of his best and most populous districts. The
homesteads were all scattered over a wide and well-cultivated
area, which extended with a northerly aspect along the
declivity of an elevation of gneiss that rose to an altitude
of about 200 feet. This hill was named Gumango; before
we reached it we had to cross a considerable stream called
the Rye, which throughout the year is always flowing.
Uninfluenced hitherto by the rain, its breadth was now about
forty feet, and its depth was sufficient to allow us to enjoy a
pleasant bath at a spot where it ran beneath the shelter of
some thick <i lang="la">Psychotriæ</i>. Tall popukky grass covered the
banks, amidst which the splendid Nathalia, with its blossoms
fine as those of a horse-chestnut, rose in all its beauty. The
whole region, on either side the stream, was well cultivated,
and look whichever way we would, we saw groups of farmsteads,
although villages, in our sense of the term, did not
exist.</p>

<p>Each family resides close to, if not actually upon, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
land it cultivates. The insecurity of property is everywhere
so great, that rather than relinquish their incessant watch
over their crops, the people submit to many inconveniences
and live far away from watercourses, put up with short
supply of firewood, and brave the ravages of the white ants.
Hostility, in this land, does not simply mean plunder and
escape; the enemy is vengeful, and if he can carry nothing
off, will damage all he finds, and destroy the rising crops.</p>

<p>The Rye empties itself into the river Sway, as the Dyoor
is termed by the Niam-niam, although by the Bongo and
Dyoor it is called the Geddy. Close to the rising eminence
of Gumango, the Rye upon its left shore receives a considerable
stream flowing from the marshy plains, along the banks
of which are scattered numerous farmsteads surrounded by
plantains. This was the first time I had seen the <i lang="la">Musa
sapientium</i> in any quantities; just beyond the Nile district
in the Monbuttoo country it becomes the very staple of the
people’s food. The cultivation of the plantain seems to
be a speciality of all the equatorial regions of Africa, from
Uganda on Lake Ukerewe right away to the western lands
on the Gaboon and Ogowai.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GROVE OF ZAWA-TREES.</div>

<p>Our encampment had been made to the north-east of
Gumango in a great grove of Zawa trees (<i lang="la">Lophira alata</i>). Of
this tree very few detached specimens are met with. It
belongs to a class which flourishes beyond the range of the
woods of the river banks, and will grow on a tolerably dry
soil. Very noble is it in its growth, and so fine, that Colonel
Grant has pronounced it to be the fairest memorial of his
famous tour. Its bark is jet black, and it has a cylindrical
crown of narrow quivering leaves, which vary in length from
a foot to a foot and a half, whilst their breadth is rarely a
couple of inches. Whilst it is young the colour of the foliage
is purple, which subsequently changes to a deep sap-green.
Every leaf is of a leathery texture, deeply wrinkled, and its
surface smooth as if it were varnished. The blossoms repose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
in thick masses upon the extremities of the boughs; in colour
they resemble those of the tea-tree, and emit a fragrant odour
sweet as roses. It is one of the most serviceable productions
of the country, as its fruit, which is about as large as a hazel-nut,
yields a prolific supply of oil, of which the quality is
singularly pure, while it is neither rank in smell nor coarse
in taste. For my own part I much prefer the oil that is
thus obtained to either that of the oil-palm, or of the butter-tree.</p>

<p>All the morning I pursued my botanising on the river
Rye, and all the afternoon upon the sides and summits of
Gumango. The arched surface of the rising mound of gneiss,
stretching out without a rift, was the habitat of several very
interesting ferns. Here I found the first specimen of <i lang="la">Encephalartus</i>
which had ever been discovered in the northern
latitudes of Africa. The joy of this surprise was no transient
thing; but as often as the eye of the collector glances over
the treasures he has brought from afar, it surveys a permanent
memorial of his successful tour. The Ensete or wild
Musa of Africa, which the Niam-niam call the “Boggumboly”
(or little plantain) grows likewise in great abundance upon
this interesting hill.</p>

<p>As surveyed from the summit of Gumango, the country,
with the variegated colours of its cultivated enclosures,
exhibited a thoroughly European aspect. Ploughed fields
are nowhere to be seen, but the labour is limited to clearing
out the weeds, and loosening the surface of the mould to
receive the fine-grained eleusine, which no doubt requires
more care than sorghum, which latter is sown broadcast.</p>

<p>All the farmsteads at this time had been deserted by their
occupants, who had gone away and abandoned their well-stored
granaries. Compared to the number of residences the
store of provisions was very great, especially when the
advanced season of the year is taken into account, for April
was the month in which the new seeds should be planted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
out. One with another the huts had three granaries each,
two of which were full of eleusine in its original condition,
the remaining one being devoted to the same grain after it
had been malted.</p>

<p>Everything testified to the fruitfulness of the soil. Sweet-potatoes,
yams, and colocasiæ were piled up in heaps, and
our hungry Bongo and Mittoo fell upon them as though they
had entered a hostile country. The receptacles for corn,
being circular erections of clay, supported on posts, and
furnished with a covering which lifted up and down like a
lid, were soon emptied, and the immediate neighbourhood of
our quarters was like a scene of rapine and plunder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIAM-NIAM HUTS.</div>

<p>The arrangements of the Niam-niam huts are much the
same throughout the land. Two, or at most three, families
reside close together. Generally from eight to twelve huts
are clustered round one common open space, which is kept perfectly
clean, and in the centre of which is reared a post upon
which the trophies of the chase are hung. Skulls of the rarest
kind, splendid horns of antelopes and buffaloes, are attached to
this standard, and, it must be added, skulls of men and withered
hands and feet! Close in the rear of the huts, upon the level
ground, were the magazines for corn; behind these would be
seen a circle of Rokko fig-trees, which are only found in
cultivated spots, and the bark of which is prized, far more
than the handsomest of skins, as a material to make into
clothing. Further in the background might be noticed a
perfect enclosure of paradise figs; then in wider circumference
the plantations of manioc and maize; and, lastly,
the outlying fields of eleusine extending to the compound
next beyond. I sketched several of the huts, which are
embellished externally with black and white decorations.
Several of the dwellings had roofs which rose upwards in
two points; long poles projected from the peaks alike of
huts and of granaries, and on these were strung rows of great
land-snails (<i lang="la">Achatina</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span></p>

<p>After some time we found Bendo himself arrayed in an
apron of red flannel which had been given him by Mohammed.
He looked very much disconcerted at seeing his property
laid under such heavy contribution, but he was utterly
helpless to arrest the havoc. The promise was given that
Mohammed, when he arrived, would compensate him for all
his loss by ample presents of copper rings and other gifts;
and, as matter of fact, we found Bendo, at the time of our
return, perfectly satisfied in his old quarters, and ready to
show many proofs of the friendly interest with which he
regarded me.</p>

<p>Besides Bendo and Gumba, Nganye had four brothers,—&#8203;Imma,
Mango, Nyongalia, and Mbeli,—&#8203;who acted as his
deputies, and had the charge of various districts. Intimidated
by his alliance with Aboo Sammat, they were subservient
to him with the obedience of vassals. There was,
however, a seventh brother, Mbagahli, known by his Arabic
name of Surroor, who was the direct subordinate of Aboo
Sammat, and had been established in command of the wide
country vanquished by him, which was bounded by the
territories of Nganye, Wando, and Mbeeoh. Nganye had
only two sons recognised as legitimate, Imbolutiddoo and
Mattindoo, the former of which was destined to be the heir
of his dignity. Nganye’s father was Moonuba, one of the
six sons of Yapahti, who must not be confused with another
prince of the same name whose territories lay to the south
of Dar Ferteet.</p>

<p>On the 6th of February our march was maintained for a
distance of six leagues until we arrived at the Sway. Whilst
marching in single file it was very difficult to hold any communication
with those who were before me or behind. Thus
for a great part of the way I kept up no conversation at all,
and had to obtain all my information about the country at
the places where we halted, and where from the examination
of several people I could learn the truth; going always upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
the principle that in Africa what <em>two</em> witnesses state has
some degree of probability, but when <em>three</em> agree, there is a
moral certainty. As we proceeded, my attention was sufficiently
occupied by observing the plants on both sides of our
road, and every now and then I counted our steps in order
to ascertain our rate of marching, the people, meanwhile,
giving me the credit for muttering my prayers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEUTRALITY.</div>

<p>For the first and last time during our whole journey, I
had a sharp contention with Aboo Sammat’s soldiers. Their
conduct to the natives excited my indignation more and more
every day, and an incident now occurred that thoroughly
passed my powers of endurance. I could not without remonstrance
allow one of the Nubians to maltreat the bearer that
had been consigned to him by Bendo, and to strike him till
his face was covered with blood, merely because he had
broken a common calabash. But however much my sympathy
with the negroes might make me a favourite with
them, it could only be exhibited at the cost of a sacrifice of
friendship with the Nubians, who were so indispensable for
my comfort and necessities. I got the reputation of being a
partisan and defender of the blacks, and more than once I
was bitterly reproached because, as it was said, I reckoned
the word of one negro of more account than that of ten
Mussulmans. Under all similar circumstances, I learnt as
far as I could to keep myself neutral, and thus happily I
avoided much friction with either party. But it should be
mentioned that I was never a witness of that abandoned
cruelty and systematic inhumanity which the accounts of
previous travellers in the lands of the Upper Nile might
lead us to expect. A traveller to be just will take into consideration
all the circumstances of the case and all the
ameliorating particulars which may be alleged; but in the
majority of these narratives, which make the hair almost
stand on end, the judgment that is passed is not unfrequently
warped and exaggerated. There is no justification for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
pride with which we civilised people boast of our humanity.
We have only to reflect upon the horrors that follow in the
train of our wars, and if we could enfranchise ourselves from
prejudice we should be compelled to allow that we are worse
barbarians than all the Nubians—&#8203;nay, that we are murderers
by deliberate intention, and destroyers of the happiness of
the homes of thousands.</p>

<p>As ill-luck would have it, on this same day a bullet came
whistling by close to my ear. Once before, during my stay
at Fashoda, on the White Nile, as the reader may recollect,
I had been in peril of my life through the excessive carelessness
of the Nubian soldiers in handling their arms; and not
only was the danger renewed now, but a few days later it
was repeated for the third time. On this occasion a group
had camped out on the side of the road as I was defiling
past in the caravan. One of the men had his comrade’s
gun in his hand, and was apparently examining it, when, as
I was within a few paces of him, it went off. All that I
heard was the cry of alarm on the part of the man that he
wished he had known the gun was loaded; my own people
flocked around me in consternation, but I passed on without
turning my head, as though I had heard nothing. After the
events of the day my mode of proceeding was designed to
make an impression on the people, and succeeded in winning
the hearts of all, especially as I never passed a single
remark upon the whole transaction. The result was that
everyone looked upon me as protected by a good star, and
that every attempt upon my life would be utterly unavailing.</p>

<p>Our further progress led us, for two leagues from the residence
of Bendo, along cultivated lands which were covered
with farmsteads. On either hand, and apparently united with
Gumango, stretched out ranges of granite hills to the south
and south-east. One hill in particular lay to the left of our
way, which was very long, but not higher than Gumango.
The three succeeding leagues were all down-hill across a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
desert, and we had to pass some marshy courses, and several
of what for want of a better name may be called “meadow-waters,”
which at this season of the year were quite dry.
These localities in Kanori, the dialect of Bornoo, are called
“nyalyam.” Barth mentions them as one of the most
characteristic features of Central Africa, between the Shary
and the Benwe.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The prevailing character of the landscape
was that of a steppe lowland, broken now and then by park-like
woods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SWAY.</div>

<p>The southern limit of Nganye’s territory is reached at
the river Sway, which flows through the desert land which
bounds alike his territories and Aboo Sammat’s. Just one
league before we arrived at the river we passed the hamlets
of Marra, who was a “behnky” of Nganye’s. The Sway is the
upper Dyoor, and according to the uniform representations
of the Niam-niam, it is considered as the main stream. I
came across its source at the mountain of Baginze, where,
although it is but a little brook, it is called by the same
name. The proofs that I can adduce for the identity of the
Dyoor and Sway are conclusive enough to establish it for
a certainty, and they appear worthy of some special notice
here, since they may serve to throw some light upon the
question of the independence of the Welle, as a system
distinct from that of the Nile basin.</p>

<p>1. There is no doubt that the length of the river’s course
between the two points where I crossed it, the one in Marra’s
district and the other in Bongo-land, near Manganya, amounts
to 145 miles; but the positions, which I accurately determined,
of the south Bongo Seribas, belonging to Ghattas and
Kurshook Ali, and the assertion of these two men that the
Dyoor flows due north from a distance of at least 70 miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
above the fording-place near Manganya, virtually reduce the
portion of the course that I did not explore to one-half.</p>

<p>2. At Marra, the Sway was already a stream with a volume
of water sufficient to have an important share in the formation
of the Dyoor.</p>

<p>3. All the Niam-niam that were questioned by me in
Kurkur and Dangah, and who came from parts of their
native land adjacent to these places, plainly and uniformly
called the Dyoor by the name of the Sway; and without
ever having been to Marra they were quite aware that the
river came from the parts intermediate between the lands of
Nganye and Wando.</p>

<p>4. Upon the road which the roving ivory companies of
Mundo take over what was formerly Tombo’s territory, the
Sway is crossed near Fomboa, at a place that corresponds to
the curve which the river describes in my map.</p>

<p>5. The most important river flowing towards the north and
east that must be crossed by expeditions proceeding southwards
from Dem Bekeer in Dar Ferteet, is the Nomatilla or
Nomatina, which according to all accounts is identical with
the upper course of the Wow or Nyenahm, and is at all
events the largest tributary of the Dyoor. From Solongoh’s
residence, past which it flows, the Nubians have followed the
course of the Nomatilla right down into the lands of the
Bongo and Dyoor. There are no other important tributaries
that the Dyoor can possibly receive upon the left; the Sway
must, therefore, necessarily be the whole and entire upper
course of the Dyoor.</p>

<p>To myself it was a great satisfaction thus to have placed
beyond a doubt the origin of at least one of the principal
source streams of the region of the upper Nile; and thus
definitely to have assigned its geographical position to Mount
Baginze.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HYDROGRAPHY OF THE SWAY.</div>

<p>The Sway flows past Marra along a level steppe, which on
account of the rapid flow and deep channel of the river can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
only rarely, and that at the time of the rainfall, be under
water. At this time the banks were perpendicular, rising to
a height of some 18 or 20 feet, and being cut through layers
of alluvial soil very much reminded one of the Nile “guefs.”
The distance between bank and bank was 40 feet, but the
actual river was now about 25 feet wide. Its depth was about
4 feet, and it was flowing at the rate of 120 feet a minute.
The volume of water which passed was thus 200 cubic feet
in a second, whilst the Dyoor, before its union with the Wow,
at the dry season in the end of December, did not roll onward
a volume of more than 1176 cubic feet. In the middle of
June again the Sway had a volume of 1650 cubic feet to the
second; whilst the Dyoor in the rainy season, at the point I
have just mentioned, exhibited a volume of 8800 to 14,800
cubic feet.</p>

<p>This apparent discrepancy between the proportions of
water of the two rivers at the opposite seasons of the year,
is nevertheless quite in accordance with physical laws, and is
consequently adapted to the purposes of demonstration. The
drainage of the land outwards from its springs takes place in
definite channels. These channels are represented by the
great rivers which take their rise in the highest districts.
The rain, uniformly spread throughout the country, makes
its escape to its destination by the courses which are periodically
opened in the smaller streams which become tributary
to the larger. Compared, therefore, to what they are in the
winter, the great rivers are not during the rainy season proportionately
increased to the same extent as the smaller.</p>

<p>All the tributaries of the Dyoor (even to the great Wow,
to which the Dyoor owes at least one-third of its volume), as
far as they are known to me, have in winter the most trifling
significance. Upon the right are the Rye, the Lako, and
the Lengbe; on the left the Hoo, the Yubbo, and the Bikky.
Any small addition which the little affluents might be able
to yield in the winter is all lost by infiltration and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
evaporation, so that their entire and united efficiency is so
unimportant as to be of no account whatever.</p>

<p>The sun had not risen on the 7th of February when we
started on our passage over the river. A bath, no doubt, after
the heat and fatigue of the previous day was very refreshing,
but on this occasion it was involuntary; and as we waded
up to our necks in water I was conscious of sacrificing the
cosy warmth which a preparatory cup of tea had given my
stomach to the cause of science.</p>

<p>Through a charming bush forest, which, though destitute
of large trees, was most imposing in the luxuriance and size
of its foliage, our long column continued its march. These
bush woods, remarkable for the large dimensions of their
leaves, predominate everywhere throughout the countries of
the Bongo and of the Niam-niam; they contain little of the
nature of the steppes, except in parts where there is space
left for the grass to spring up in abundance. Districts destitute
of trees could not anywhere be found except upon the
rocky flats or amidst the damp and marshy lowlands. The
outspread of green was so universal, that, camp where we
would, we were like the eggs in a bowl of salad. Let arable
land lie but a couple of years in fallow, and it will break out
into a young but dense plantation; the roots of the shrubs
that have been cut down send up new shoots, and the whole
is soon again a mass of verdure. It should nevertheless be
mentioned that every tree that is either fine in itself or useful
in its product is always spared and allowed to stand. The
charm of the landscape at this early season of the year is
very fascinating, and beyond a question April and May are
months full of delight in Africa.</p>

<p>Before noon we had reached the little river Hoo, which
after flowing as far as the eye could reach through continued
steppes, at a spot a few leagues further down unites itself to
the Sway. At this period it was a mere brook rather than a
river, with a level sandy bed varying from 35 to 20 feet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
breadth; it had but a languid flow and seldom was above
2 feet in depth. The banks are very low, and the rainfall
consequently soon makes it overflow its limits and swamp
the adjacent steppes as far as the very limits of the woods.
The plants which flourish on its borders, trees and shrubs
alike, clearly reveal that for months together they have been
under water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUFFALOES AND ELEPHANTS.</div>

<p>We took an hour’s rest, which was spent in making a cup
of tea and in disposing of a kala-bok (<i lang="la">Antilope leucotis</i>) which
I had shot upon our way as a herd had crossed our path. A
fine landscape was open before us to the east, and upon the
outspread plain were herds of buffaloes of which the movements
afforded us some entertainment. They went to and
fro in groups of several hundreds along the ground that was
furrowed by their tracks, and over land which in the dry
season alone was rugged and uneven. Whenever we crossed
any extensive river-plains we always fell in with herds of
buffaloes; but we observed that vestiges of elephants were
comparatively very rare, although the indications were not
wanting that even quite recently some had been upon the
scene. But to these sagacious creatures a trodden path is a
thing to be eschewed, and they prefer to pursue their long
marches under the obscurity of night. If any one would
prosecute elephant-hunting to advantage, he must, as a
matter of course, renounce every other aim whatever.</p>

<p>From the flats where the Hoo lay low, we proceeded
through an undulating rocky bush-wood to an adjacent brook
called the Atoborroo. Sunk in a deep chasm 80 feet deep
it was hardly perceptible from above, and streamed on over-massed
by the densest marsh foliage. The vegetation
of the woods offered me a fresh feast of plants that I had
never before seen, and I enjoyed an especial pleasure in the
discovery of thickets of a species of ginger-plant, which
filled the valley all around with the most delicious aromatic
perfume, and grew quite down to the edge of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span></p>

<p>Damp and foggy was the following morning as our caravan
moved on its way. We had proceeded but a short distance
when our advanced party came to a standstill. This was a
symptom that a brook or river of some sort had obstructed
further progress. These continual delays and interruptions
contributed somewhat to the difficulty of keeping a systematic
record of my wayfaring experiences. Through the tall
grass and high bushes I endeavoured to push my way to the
head of the line, but I could only succeed in arriving in
time to see the first company follow their banner over the
Manzilly. Along a ravine deeply overhung by the broad
branching foliage of the fig-trees, the stream rushed on to
the north-east, a direction precisely the reverse of what was
followed by the Hoo, which ultimately received the waters
of all the minor streams which came from the western
heights. At every time of the year these water-courses are
all very rapid, and generally speaking they run over gravel
beds in distinction from the marshy mould of the more
sluggish streams. In these cases the tedious process of
undressing is limited to merely taking off one’s socks and
boots, and this is a considerable saving of time.</p>

<p>Shortly after this we came to a small, albeit a very small
piece of primeval forest, containing giant fig-trees, commonly
called gum-trees, and indeed of a species not unlike the
<i lang="la">Ficus elastica</i>. As a forerunner of greater surprises still to
come, there rose before my view the first thicket of the
calamus (the rotang or Spanish reed), which deserves a foremost
place in every description of the woods that line the
river-banks in the Niam-niam lands. It was a “gallery”
or avenue in miniature, such as I should find on a larger
scale along the side of nearly all the smaller streams to the
south. This conception, so necessary to an adequate topographical
representation of the land, will be discussed in a
somewhat later page.</p>

<p>After a while we reached a second brook beside the farmsteads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
of Kulenjo, which are the first settlements of the
Niam-niam subject to the immediate control of Aboo Sammat.
The possessions of each separate Niam-niam are parted from
each other, just in the same way as the territories of the
different tribes, by desolate intervals void of any residents
whatever, nominally for the purpose of security, so that the
inhabitants may by placing out a watch easily guard against
any sudden attack. When there is mutual distrust, or in
times of open war, watches are of little service in signalling
danger, for then every Niam-niam, as a true hunter, passes
his whole time in watching and lying in wait.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TROPICAL FOREST.</div>

<p>During the entire day I occupied myself among the
magnificent thickets on the stream near Kulenjo, the vegetation,
so different from what I had seen in other parts of
the Nile district, and of which I had had only a foretaste on
the Atazilly, being here revealed in its full splendour. The
flora embraces the majority of the plants of the western
coasts of tropical Africa that are known on the Gaboon, the
Niger, and the Gambia, and overstepping the watershed
dividing the Nile districts from the basin of the Tsad,
opens to the traveller from the north the unexpected glory
of the wildernesses of Central Africa. Though all was but
a faint reflection of the rich luxuriance of the primeval
forests of Brazil, yet, in contrast to what had gone before, it
could not fail to be very charming. Throughout the twenty-six
degrees of latitude over which I travelled, the progress
of vegetation, according to the geographical zone and the
meteorological condition of the successive lands, was organised
with wonderful simplicity. For the first 800 miles stretched
the dreary desert, giving place to wide steppes, void of trees,
but ever covered with grass; next came the delightful region
of the bush forests, where the vegetation, divested of the
obnoxious thorns of the desert, recalled the soft foliage of his
native land to the mind of the traveller, who lastly entered
upon what he might correctly call the true primeval forest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
which carried him back to the memories of his youth when
he yielded his fancy to the fascinations of ‘Robinson Crusoe’
or of ‘Paul and Virginia.’ An identical change gradually
supervening in the character of vegetation is perceptible in
a contrary direction in the southern half of the continent;
and travellers proceeding from the Cape northwards to the
Equator have rarely failed to draw attention to the fact.</p>

<p>Nature everywhere proceeds upon the principle of levelling
what is opposite and balancing what is extreme: she would
seem to abhor the sharply-defined boundaries in which man
delights so much, and in accordance with this law she here
presents to the eye of the inquirer a transition that is very
gradual, so that the limits of her districts overlap one
another like the fingers of folded hands. Even in lat. 7° <abbr title="North">N.</abbr>
small isolated tracts of bank-forest, bearing, however, the
characteristic types of the “gallery” flora, are scattered like
enclaves among the bush-forests of the distant north. The
forests at Okale, at Yagla, and the locality called “Genana,”
are examples which I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>Nowhere did the guinea-fowl afford better sport than along
the stream at Kulenjo; about noon their grey plumage could
be seen in the shade of the foliage as they perched aloft in
the trees at the edge of the wood, where they could be
brought down one after another with the greatest ease. The
keen vision of the Niam-niam did me good service in spying
out the birds from a distance, for the waving green around
me made me almost blind. The early morning likewise is
not an unfavourable time for getting at guinea-fowl; they
begin their flight very shortly after sunrise, but even then
they are too much occupied in securing their food to heed the
approach of any tolerably cautious sportsman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEEDING THE BEARERS.</div>

<p>The reader may perchance wonder at my frequent mention
of these guinea-fowl, and I would therefore be allowed to
explain that the traveller in Africa would be quite at a loss
without them, as, with rare exceptions, they form the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
commodity of his daily <i lang="fr">cuisine</i>. In the course of five years
I daresay I brought down as many as a thousand of these
birds, generally two at a time. By using the lightest shot
that can be obtained, and aiming high, failure is quite exceptional,
as the smallest grain that hits the long neck is sure to
bring down the game. With dogs, even when untrained,
securing the birds is a still more easy matter. The guinea-fowl
cannot fly far at a time, and therefore when they perceive
the dogs in the long grass, they seem to realise their
inability to escape, and take refuge on the nearest bough.
Often while my dogs have surrounded a tree, I have brought
down from a distance of thirty or forty feet one guinea-fowl
after another, without a single bird having ventured to leave
its hiding-place.</p>

<p>In marching for three days across an open wilderness, the
caravan had to be provided by Kulenjo with their ordinary
meals, and it was no easy matter in a region so scantily
populated to find the necessary food for a thousand hungry
mouths. The feeding took place in the evening, and before
sunrise in the morning. The whole party of bearers were
divided into groups, to which the food was distributed by the
different “nyare,” or local Bongo overseers, who generally
accompany the leaders of these longer expeditions. Handfuls
of corn, measured out just as though they were portions for
camels or asses, and lumps of bread composed of coarsely-ground
impure Teleboon-corn (eleusine), boiled to a pulp,
formed the wretched allotment and composed the substance
of a meal such as we should hesitate at giving even to our
cattle. Frequently in the wilderness they are reduced to
the necessity of cooking and eating their corn unground. In
comparison with this vile and wretched provision, linseed-cake
and bran would be accepted by the Bongo and Mittoo
bearers as choice delicacies. The natives bring them their
pulpy bread in baskets, and by counting the great lumps of
dough, which were packed in green leaves, it was possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
with some approximation to truth, to estimate the number of
families appointed to take their share in providing the supplies.</p>

<p>Dainties more tempting and <i lang="fr">recherché</i> were brought in
gourd-shells. The natives who brought these alone formed
a goodly company, consisting chiefly of boys and children;
the women, being shy, and also jealously guarded by their
husbands, remained behind at home.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention the vegetables, which, when
circumstances permitted, were also brought for the bearers.
These vegetables, served with sauces, were arranged in hundreds
of gourd-shells, pots, and bowls, round the immense
pile of the so-called bread. The sauces, which were greatly
relished by the Bongo, consisted of a compound of animal
and vegetable grease, water, soda, and aromatic herbs. The
chief ingredients in the finer sorts were grains of sesame and
hyptis, pounded to a pulp, whilst the inferior kinds were
mainly composed of the Zawa-oil of the <i lang="la">Lophira alata</i> and oil
of termites. Those with the most piquant flavour are made
of dried fish, which is pounded and rolled into balls like
cheese; in consequence of the heat of the climate these very
soon acquire a <i lang="fr">haut goût</i>. Neither Bongo nor Niam-niam will
touch pimento, as they consider its very pungency to be an
evidence of its poisonous properties; consequently they seek
a substitute in stinking fermented matter.</p>

<p>Common salt is absolutely unknown in this part of Africa;
the only salt to be procured being extracted from the ashes
of the wood of the <i lang="la">Grewia</i>; consequently the greasy soups
when boiled coagulate almost into a kind of soap, and their
flavour may be more easily imagined than described. To
make specially attractive sauces there is added the flesh of
elephants and buffaloes, which has been previously dried and
pounded. Any fat from meat is all but unknown: Nature
appears to have quite denied any supply to animals that are
wild, and the Niam-niam have no domestic animals like their
neighbours; whilst the fat of dogs and men, even if it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
not loathsome to the Bongo, would be far too rare and
costly to be used for such a purpose. Such is the usual
food supplied to the native bearers, and according to their
notion it is probable that no more grateful diet could be
prescribed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VEGETABLES.</div>

<p>At some seasons other products of the soil, such as the
larger kinds of gourds, are added to the catalogue of supplies.
Gourd-leaves, too, which can be gathered throughout the
year, together with various herbs, which are found neither
to be unwholesome nor to have the flavour of pimento, are
pounded and mixed with the soups. Vegetables proper are
rarely grown, but whatever weeds may spring up on all cultivated
soils are employed as a substitute, and play as important
a part in the economy of the food as many articles that
are used on our own tables; they serve partly as material to
thicken the soups, and partly as nourishment to satisfy hunger.
As I proceeded further on my journey, I found that manioc,
sweet-potatoes, and green plantains took the place of the
corn-pap and Bongo sauces, whilst it should be observed
that in the more northerly regions cereals formed the basis
of the food.</p>

<p>On the twelfth morning of our march I rose with the welcome
prospect of that day reaching Aboo Sammat’s Seriba.
Attending to my toilet, and taking my time over my breakfast,
I did not quit the camp at Kulenjo until long after the
last of the bearers had left. The day brought me along
a charming walk, and yielded a fine harvest of botanical
treasures; we crossed four streams, passed several isolated
hamlets, and finally entered a dense forest of lofty trees.
This was no park with its alternations of meadows and
thickets, trees and groves: it was a veritable forest in our
northern sense, but infinitely more lovely and varied, and not
marked by the solemn monotony of our native woods. In
contrast to the surrounding country, the forest land extended
over an area of many miles to the north and south of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
Seriba, and nowhere did it show an exclusive predominance
of any single species. Trees there were most striking and
stately, but the most remarkable circumstance about them
was the diversity they displayed; a fact that may be comprehended,
when it is stated that amongst thirty adjacent
trees were found representatives of no less than twenty
different classes.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the native chieftains, as I have already mentioned,
had exhibited so much hostility, and had been so great
an obstacle to Mohammed Aboo Sammat’s ivory trade in
Wando’s district, that Mohammed had proceeded to violence
and had wrested away his territory. This chieftain was now
dead, and Mohammed in his place had appointed a native
spearman of royal blood. Mohammed had a considerable
number of these spearmen, natives of the Niam-niam
country, who were brought into his Seribas, and having
been initiated into the use of fire-arms, formed one of the
main supports of his authority. Backed by the continual
presence of some forty or fifty armed Nubians, Surroor (for
such was the name of the new vicegerent) held sway over
a populous area of 700 square miles. According to the joint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>
estimate made by Mohammed and Surroor, the number of
men in the territory capable of bearing arms was not less
than 40,000. I believe, however, that half this number
would be nearer the mark; for when I test my impressions
by comparing them with the results of my careful investigations
in Bongo-land, I cannot but think that the entire
population of the Niam-niam country, with its wide tracts
of wilderness utterly uninhabited, hardly averages 65 to the
square mile.</p>

<p>Since here amongst the bearers there is no institution of
statute labour, and the number of villages and huts could
only be arrived at by careful scrutiny of an entire district,
the only means open to me for estimating the amount of
population was by taking what reckoning I could of the
people who assembled on either side of our route as we
passed along. These may be divided into three classes:
first, those who had come from mere curiosity; secondly,
those who had been ordered to settle in a district to contribute
towards the general means of subsistence; and,
thirdly, the fighting-force that was displayed in various
places during time of war, and which most probably represented
the large majority of the men who were capable of
bearing arms.</p>

<p>The strongholds in this district consist of one large Seriba
and three smaller palisaded enclosures. In these subsidiary
settlements discipline is maintained by native overseers with
a small detachment of armed men.</p>

<p>The personal relation of the Niam-niam towards their
rulers was far less servile than what I had observed among
the Bongo and Mittoo. The duties imposed were mainly
the same. They were bound to assemble promptly at any
signal either for war or for hunting, to provide an adequate
support for whatever soldiers and bearers might be brought
into the country; to furnish wood and straw for building
purposes, and to perform various incidental labours. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
Niam-niam, however, are not employed as bearers upon the
expeditions, and upon the whole are less oppressed and are
treated with more consideration than the Bongo. At present
they can hardly comprehend their state of subjection, and
this indefinite feeling is fostered at first by leniency on the
part of the oppressors, that they may smooth the way for
severer measures in the future.</p>

<p>The power of any native chiefs among such a people of
unsettled habits and unpliant temper as the Niam-niam—&#8203;a
people delighting in the chase—&#8203;is necessarily at present
very limited; it cannot extend any further at all than to
accomplish the disposal of whatever men may be capable of
bearing arms either for the purpose of warfare or of hunting.
The official emoluments of these chiefs are derived partly
from an allowance made upon all the ivory that is secured,
which is always paid without being contested, and partly
from their having a right to half of all the elephant meat;
but for their ordinary subsistence they have to turn their
attention to the cultivation of the fields; and for this purpose
they endeavour to increase their home establishments by the
acquisition of as many wives and women-slaves as their
resources will allow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOO SAMMAT’S SERIBA.</div>

<p>I remained at this place from the 10th to the 26th of
February. The Seriba was in lat. 4° 50´ N., and was 87
miles south—&#8203;almost due south—&#8203;of Sabby. It was situated
in the angle formed by the confluence of two streams, the
Nabambisso and the Boddo, which were overhung by lofty
trees, and in some places were enclosed by dense thickets.
Close at hand was the “mbanga” of Surroor.</p>

<p>I spent the daytime in an assiduous investigation of the
neighbouring woods. My collection increased considerably,
and the paper packets prepared for the reception of my
treasures were rapidly filled up. The crowds of natives who
came from far and near to gaze upon me afforded me an
acceptable opportunity of filling up some pages in my album.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
My two Niam-niam interpreters (called in Arabic Gyabir and
Amber) felt at home upon their native soil, and accompanied
me everywhere, making my intercourse with the natives
perfectly easy. I was able to roam about at will in the
adjacent jungles, as the environs were as safe as those of
Ghattas’ Seriba in the Dyoor; and, altogether, I was soon as
comfortable as I could desire in this remote land.</p>

<p>The scenery was lovely; the two streams never failed
throughout the year to be well supplied with water, and
flowed through deep glades where the lofty trees were
wreathed and festooned with creepers in clustered grace that
would have been an ornament to any palm-house. In the
part where the supply of water was diverted to the residences
the woods had been considerably thinned. The wild date-palm
(<i lang="la">Phœnix spinosa</i>), which may be considered as the
original of the species cultivated throughout the desert
region from Senegambia to the Indus, grows here as a low
shrub, and together with the calamus forms an impenetrable
hedge along the banks of the stream. The double barbs
of the calamus cling tenaciously to the skin and clothes,
reminding one of the prickly acacia to which the Boers, or
Dutch colonists in South Africa, have given the name of
“wag-a-bitjen,” <i>i. e.</i> wait-a-bit.</p>

<p>A new characteristic of the flora appears here in the
Amomum, which I found in tall masses on the damp soil
near the bed of the stream, and even in the water itself.
I saw five different species, with white, yellow, and crimson
flowers. The fruit of all the kinds is bright red, and contains
a soft pulp which has a flavour like citron, and which envelopes
the aromatic seeds known as grains of paradise. The
water of the streams runs clear as crystal, and the traveller
may at any time allay his thirst by a cooling draught. Here
and there the sun’s rays force their way through the interlacing
creepers which hang in festoons between stem and
stem, and in the twilight the foliage gleams almost like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
burnished metal. The Ashantee pepper (<i lang="la">Cubeba Clusii</i>)
clothes the trunks with a close network which is thickly
covered with bright red berries that grow in clusters as long
as one’s finger. After the fruit has been dried it makes a very
good substitute for black pepper, which it very much resembles
in flavour. I was the first to draw the attention of the
Nubians to the plant, for, although they had travelled much
in the Niam-niam lands, they had no idea that these berries
had the properties of pepper, and seemed highly gratified at
the discovery. The Niam-niam take the pepper only as a
medicine; for seasoning their dishes they are accustomed to
use the Malaghetta pepper (<i lang="la">Habzelia</i>), of which we shall have
to speak on a later page. The Ashantee-pepper is one of the
most common and yet at the same time one of the most
striking of the characteristics of the primeval forests of the
district; it forms the finest adornment of the giant trees, and
covers the venerable stems of these princes of the vegetable
kingdom with a vesture of royal purple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KOKKOROKOO.</div>

<p>One amongst the most imposing forms of vegetation is
found in a Sterculia of the Cola tribe, called “kokkorokoo.”
This tree grows to a height of 80 or 90 feet; the stem
gradually tapers upwards to a point, whilst at the base it is
suddenly expanded to so great a bulk that it would require
eight or ten men to encircle it; thence it rises in a mass
of narrow arms, corresponding to the direction of the roots,
shooting upwards for many feet, like a series of planks joined
together edge to edge. The leaves are heart-shaped and
form a light and airy foliage, but this commences at such
a height above the ground that I was for some time in doubt
about the true form of the tree. At length I discovered
a shoot bursting from a root that enabled me to realise
a proper idea of the plant. It is no uncommon thing in
these primeval forests for the botanist thus to see the object
of his desire at a height so far above his head that he is
unable to attain so much as a single leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span></p>

<p>It was upon the Boddo that I found the first specimens of
Anthocleista. The flora of the Niam-niam countries contains
several species of this genus of the Loganiaceæ, which
is remarkable for the immense size and small number of its
leaves that grow all together at the crown of a single stem
running up without a branch. Let any one imagine a
tobacco plant magnified to ten times its natural size and
placed upon the top of a stem some twenty feet high, and he
will then have some idea of this plant with its circling
labyrinth of leaves. In any drawing of a landscape the
Anthocleista defies every rule of perspective. The equatorial
zone alone can boast of plants so unique in character
as these, which may be considered as samples of the unexplored
splendour of the primeval forests of Brazil.</p>

<p>After every ramble I turned my steps to Surroor’s mbanga,
and my visits there were always enjoyable, because I ever
found something fresh that sensibly enlarged my knowledge
of the country. There was invariably a large assemblage
of natives about the vicegerent’s court, and among them
a considerable number of women; for Surroor, besides his
thronging harem, kept a great many female slaves in
attendance upon himself and his wives. As a guest of
Mohammed’s I was always treated here with the utmost
respect. The most elaborate benches and stools were brought
out for me to sit on, and Surroor’s store of these exemplars
of native art was inexhaustible. The choicest delicacies of
the country were outspread before me, but these were to me
as prohibited as shewbread. I always made a rule of eating
alone, and consequently felt constrained to leave the dainties
to my interpreters and Nubian servants.</p>

<p>Yes; I took my meals alone. A solitary European, as he
proceeds farther and farther from his home, may see his old
associations shrink to a minimum; but so much the more,
with pertinacious conservatism, will he cling to the surviving
remnants of his own superiority. Nothing can ever divest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
him of the thought as to how he may maintain the prerogative,
which he takes for granted, that he is a being of
some higher order. Many a misanthrope, in his disgust at
the shady side of our modern culture, may imagine that to
a traveller, in his intercourse with the children of Nature,
the thousand necessities of daily life must seem but trifles
vain and empty, to be dispensed with without a sigh. Such
an one may fancy that the bonds which fasten him to the
world of civilisation are weak and all waiting to be rent
asunder as soon as Nature is left to assert her unfettered
rights; but from experience I can assure him that the truth
is very different. With the fear of degenerating ever before
his eyes, the wanderer from the realms of civilisation will
surely fix his gaze almost with devotion on the few objects
of our Western culture that remain to him, which (however
trivial they are in themselves) become to him symbols
little less than sacred. Tables and chairs, knives and forks,
bedding, and even pocket-handkerchiefs, will assume an importance
that could never have been anticipated, and it is
hardly too much to aver that they will rise to a share in his
affections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIAM-NIAM WOMEN.</div>

<p>The social position of the Niam-niam women differs materially
from what is found amongst other heathen negroes in
Africa. The Bongo and Mittoo women are on the same
familiar terms with the foreigner as the men, and the Monbuttoo
ladies are as forward, inquisitive and prying as can
be imagined; but the women of the Niam-niam treat every
stranger with marked reserve. Whenever I met any women
coming along a narrow pathway in the woods or on the
steppes, I noticed that they always made a wide circuit to
avoid me, and returned into the path further on; and many
a time I saw them waiting at a distance with averted face,
until I had passed by. This reserve may have originated
from one of two opposite reasons. It may on the one hand
have sprung from the more servile position of the Niam-niam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
women themselves; or, on the other, it may have been
necessitated by the jealous temperament of their husbands.
It is one of the fine traits in the Niam-niam that they display
an affection for their wives which is unparalleled among
natives of so low a grade, and of whom it might be expected
that they would have been brutalised by their hunting and
warlike pursuits. A husband will spare no sacrifice to
redeem an imprisoned wife, and the Nubians, being acquainted
with this, turn it to profitable account in the ivory
trade. They are quite aware that whoever possesses a female
hostage can obtain almost any compensation from a Niam-niam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SURROOR.</div>

<p>My exceptional position made it easy for me to procure an
order from Surroor that some of his wives should sit for their
portraits. This was an unusually favourable opportunity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
and the ladies with their plaited tresses, allowed me to make
many additions to my portfolio and to my list of measurements.
In this place I measured about fifty different people,
taking no less than forty measurements of each. This of
course was the work of time, but my trouble was all in
vain, for all my notes, with many others, were destroyed in
the fire, of which the record will have to be made, on the
2nd of December. Altogether I had carefully registered the
measurements of more than 200 individuals belonging to
various nations.</p>

<p>During the time that Surroor had acted in the capacity
of Mohammed’s spearman, he had learnt to speak Arabic
fluently, and was therefore able to give me considerable information
on many points. I asked many local questions, since
the unravelling of the confused hydrographical network in
this part of the country was an object which I could never
permit to be absent from my thoughts. I was not long
however, in discovering that these Zandey (Niam-niam),
although possessing such uniformity in speech and customs,
had no more knowledge of the remote parts of their country
than the majority of the other natives of Central Africa. I
may mention, as an instance of this, that no one in this district
knew so much as the name of Mofio, whose territory
indeed was 300 miles distant, but whose reputation, as one of
the chief Niam-niam princes, might have been presumed to
be widespread.</p>

<p>Another occasion very shortly afterwards had the effect of
impressing the people about me with a very lofty notion of
the good genius which presided over my fortune, and protected
me from injury. A traveller who has learnt experience
will understand the desirableness of turning the progress
of events to the advantage of his personal reputation.
As I was about to take my seat of honour at Surroor’s side
on a Monbuttoo bench, my life for the third time was imperilled
by a bullet fired from the neighbouring Seriba. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
descending ball passed close to my left, and within a few
inches of my forehead; glancing off the palm-sticks which
were attached to my seat, it dashed through the roof of an
adjacent hut. However much I may have been alarmed, I
succeeded entirely in disguising my terror. The Nubians do
not possess any wad-hooks for extracting either cartridges or
bullets; their guns consequently have to be discharged in
order to keep them clean and in proper condition. It may
therefore be imagined that in the vicinity of a Nubian camp
there is a perpetual whirring and whizzing in the air from
the incidental firing of these stray shots.</p>

<p>Hunting in this place, as far as we were concerned, was
not to be thought of, as the region was far too thickly populated,
and the Niam-niam themselves are such devoted
huntsmen that they leave nothing for the stranger beyond
the few francolins and guinea-fowl which may escape their
snares.</p>

<p>During our sojourn, Mohammed Aboo Sammat, with his
faithful black body-guard of true Zandey, had arrived from
the Mittoo country. The entire united forces then prepared
to advance to the south, Ghattas’s agent and plenipotentiary
not considering that a division could be ventured upon until
we had gained sufficient assurance of the peaceful intentions
of Wando, whose territory we should have to cross upon our
route. Any apprehensions of hostility, however, were soon
allayed, and for a time all went well.</p>

<p>By the 25th of February all the preparations for marching
were complete, and, reckoning all Aboo Sammat’s and
Ghattas’s people, we were a body of little short of 1000
strong. Our marching column was not much less than four
miles in length, so that it happened more than once, after a
short day’s march, that those in front were erecting their
huts with leaves and grass before those in the rear had lost
sight of the smoke of the encampment of the previous night.</p>

<p>Just before starting Mohammed had sent some of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>
dependents back to Sabby, and I took the opportunity of remitting
by them the botanical collection which I had made.
Amongst other plants were two specimens of the remarkable
Cycadea, which after all the vicissitudes of travel arrived in
Europe in a state of vitality.</p>

<p>Only a small portion of my reserve of cattle was now
remaining, and the maintenance of the men in the Seriba
had quite exhausted the stores; to Mohammed’s great annoyance,
even the sorghum-seed, which was to have been conveyed
to Munza, king of the Monbuttoo, as a curiosity, had
been consumed as material of diet, and thus the heart of
Africa had been deprived of one advance in culture.</p>

<p>We proceeded, first of all, two leagues in a westerly direction,
and after crossing the Nabambisso and two smaller
streams, we made our necessary halt. It was on the western
boundary of the cultivated district subject to Aboo Sammat,
and before we could venture to quit it, an adequate relay of
provisions had to be procured from the neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEEDING THE BEARERS.</div>

<p>The feeding of the bearers was an animated scene, enlivened
as it was by the concourse of some hundreds of the Niam-niam
people. The provision for the most part consisted of
great lumps of pappy dough piled upon broad leaves, and
served with strong-smelling sauces which were brought in
pots, bowls, calabashes, and vessels of every variety. Drawn
up on one side, in groups arranged according to the order
of their arrival, stood the bearers, whilst the Niam-niam in
throngs took their position on the other, and many an eager
glance was thrown upon the preparations for the general
repast. I took my sketch-book in my hand, and wandering
through the ranks preserved my observations of the diversified
tattooing which everywhere arrested the eye.</p>

<p>To judge from the representations which have been given
us by Du Chaillu, Griffon, and other travellers, I should say
that in external appearance the Niam-niam very much resemble
the people of the Fan on the Gaboon. The two races<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
adopt a similar fashion of dressing their hair; both alike
have the reputation of being cannibals; and from all accounts
their domestic arrangements are not very different.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after starting on the following morning
we crossed the Nabambisso, and our course subsequently
lay across a group of low mounds of gneiss covered with an
interesting vegetation. Here grew in great abundance the
<i lang="la">Selaginella rupestris</i>, clothing the bare rock with a graceful
carpet of verdure; and here, too, for the first time since
leaving the Red Sea, I was greeted with the sight of the
Abyssinian aloe with its fiery barb. This plant belongs to
the flora of the loftiest mountains; but although the elevation
of the country was scarcely more than 2500 feet, yet it
was sufficiently high to permit the plant to thrive; in Nubia,
too, it flourishes at an altitude hardly higher than that in
which it is conspicuous here. After surmounting the gneiss
rocks we crossed the Nabambisso for the second time, and
marching onwards in a southerly direction we reached a wide
depression, called Yabongo, enclosed by dense bushes like the
“Luche” in the Mark of Brandenburg, or perhaps still
more like a meadow-pool in the sense of the “nyalnyam”
of Bornoo. On the edge of the water many wild <i lang="la">Phœnix</i>
of both sexes were flourishing with greater magnificence
than any I had yet seen, their stems running to the height
of some twenty feet. For a distance now there were no
watercourses above ground to be seen, and shortly afterwards
we entered upon another valley which was distinguished
by the name of Yabo. The interval between
the two hollows was filled by woodlands, graceful as parks,
and adorned by many a large-leaved fig-tree bearing a
multitude of figs much larger than those we ever grow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSIDERATION FOR BEARERS.</div>

<p>While we were here, one of the Bongo bearers died from
the effects of eating manioc before it had been prepared and
divested of its poisonous parts. For twenty-four hours before
his death he had lain in a state of coma, and a strong emetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
had been entirely without effect. In the Niam-niam countries
the manioc roots are of the same uncertain quality as
those of South America, and the Bongo being unfamiliar
with the differences, often do themselves serious injury on
their expeditions by partaking of them indiscrimately.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards another of the Bongo people was
carried off by a lion from the side of a bivouac fire; and these
two were the only deaths that occurred in the course of the
two months that Mohammed’s caravan was on its outward
way. Probably much was due to the salubrity of the air,
which contributed to make the men superior to the drawback
of unwholesome food, and to all the exertions, fatigues, and
deprivations to which they had to submit; but beyond a
doubt the fact spoke volumes for the considerate treatment
that the bearers received from Mohammed. He spared his
people most studiously, and often rated the soldiers very
severely whenever they were impatient or harsh with the
bearers; he personally superintended the distribution of all
the corn, and in his anger I have heard him revile the troops,
telling them that they were good-for-nothing rascals who only
knew how to go to sleep, and how to bully the bearers.</p>

<p>Towards noon on the 27th of March we reached the Uzze,
a small river running almost parallel with the Sway, and of
about the same dimensions as the Hoo, only having a much
slower current. The river-bed was twenty-five feet wide, but
at this period there was not more than a two-foot depth of
water. The stream flowed along an open plain, unrelieved
by trees, but animated by many herds of buffaloes, which we
did not now stay to chase, but which afforded us excellent
sport upon our way back. About two miles to the south of
the Uzze we crossed the Yubbo, the two rivers here being
quite close together, although they diverge again to a distance
of several leagues towards the west before they ultimately
unite and join the Sway.</p>

<p>The Yubbo at this time was fifty feet wide, and like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
Uzze was only two feet deep; it meandered along a low
steppe which was obviously subjected to inundation, a fact
that testified to the importance of the river in the rainy
season. Estimated merely with reference to the length of
its course, the Yubbo might compete with the Sway for the
honour of being chief among the original stream-sources which
make up the Dyoor, but the comparison of the volume of
water which the separate rivers contain demonstrates that it
really performs a very subsidiary part. Another argument
that very pointedly tends to prove that the Sway is really
the main source rests upon the fact that the natives distinguish
it, at its earliest risings, in the defiles of the Baginze,
by the same name that the Dyoor itself bears among the
Niam-niam in what were formerly the states of Tombo. The
development of the Sway, from the aggregated confluence of
a number of smaller streams, is as characteristic an example
of “river-sources” as the records of geographical science can
furnish.</p>

<p>After crossing the deep hollow of the bed of the Yubbo,
we met some messengers who had been despatched by Nduppo,
Wando’s brother, to bid us welcome. Nduppo was chief
of a district subject to his brother, with whom, however, he
was by no means on good terms. From Nduppo himself,
of course, we had no hostilities to fear, as nothing could be of
more importance to him than to preserve his friendly relations
with Mohammed. As we arrived at his mbanga some
hours before night, I had time to make a short visit to a deep
ravine at no great distance, that was watered by a streamlet
called the Nakofoh, which was almost hidden by the dense
groves upon its bank.</p>

<p>Our camp had meanwhile been improvised, a number of
grass huts having been speedily erected because of the
threatening aspect of the sky; towards evening for some
days past there had been the appearance as if a storm were
rising, but rain had only fallen twice since the beginning of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
the month, and even now the clouds were broken. On reaching
the encampment I found Nduppo himself in company
with Mohammed. I joined them, at once, being as anxious
as anyone to get what intelligence I could about Wando and
his intentions. It transpired that the feud between Nduppo
and his brother had become so violent in rancour that Nduppo
avowed that he lived in constant terror of being attacked
and murdered by Wando’s soldiers, and this cruel destiny
which he foreboded did actually befall him a very few days
after our departure. For ourselves, the following day would
decide whether we were to have peace or war.</p>

<p>Our next move was to the quarters of Rikkete, another
brother of Wando’s, and who, holding the office of behnky,
had remained faithful in his allegiance, and was consequently
in avowed hostility to Nduppo. The three brothers were
part of the numerous family of Bazimbey, whose extensive
dominions, a few years previously, had been divided into six
small principalities, a heritage which was a perpetual apple
of discord amongst his sons. Bazimbey was one of the six
sons of Yapahti, who still retain their rule over nearly all
the eastern countries of the Niam-niam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADMIRING THE WHITE MAN.</div>

<p>My personal appearance aroused the most vivid interest on
the part of Nduppo and his suite. Their curiosity seemed
insatiable, and they never wearied in their inquiries as to my
origin. Theirs were the first exclamations of a kind which
more or less frequently continued to be made throughout the
rest of my journey. To their mind the mystery was as to
where I could have come from; my hair was the greatest of
enigmas to them; it gave me a supernatural look, and
accordingly they asked whether I had been dropped from
the clouds or was a visitor from the moon, and could not
believe that anything like me had been seen before.</p>

<p>And with regard to this appearance of mine, I may
mention that amongst these people of the far interior it
hardly seemed to be the colour of my skin that principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
excited their astonishment, for even in the remotest regions
of Central Africa, tribes that have no conception of an ocean
are aware of the existence of white men; but it was invariably
my long straight hair that caused their chief surprise,
my own purpose in letting my hair grow to an unusual
length being that I might be identified at once amid all the
countless shades of complexion that were found amongst
the Nubians. I enquired whether they had not seen the
traveller Piaggia, that white man who but a few years
ago had been staying in their parts with king Tombo;
but they replied that although they had heard about
him, they had never seen him. In my way, therefore, I was
quite unique, and truly a <i lang="la">desideratum</i> in their ethnographical
experience.</p>

<p>Nduppo communicated to us many particulars about his
brothers, and about the warfare that was carried on between
them, and informed us likewise of the death of Bazimbey’s
brother Tombo, who had entertained Piaggia with so much
hospitality. Tombo’s kingdom, it appeared, had likewise
been cut up into a number of smaller states which still
retained all their national hostility to the intruders from
Khartoom. The residence at which Bazimbey had lived,
during his sovereignty, was pointed out to me, at a distance
which, I should presume, was about 25 miles. It was explained
to me that a messenger, if he were strong and could
walk well, could accomplish the journey in a day, but, it was
added that he must not halt on the way, and that he would
have to get on apace like a Niam-niam, and not to dawdle
like a Bongo bearer carrying his load.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABUNDANCE OF SKINS.</div>

<p>Throughout the whole of the territory that was subject to
Wando, the clothing of all the people consisted of skins, as the
fig-tree, of which the bark is so generally used in the south,
does not thrive here at all well. For all those who require
it, the bark has to be imported from the country of the
Monbuttoo, and is consequently an article of luxury. Skins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>
can ordinarily be obtained at a price which seemed to me
ridiculously small. For the purpose of getting a few
trifling additions which were necessary for my <i lang="fr">cuisine</i> I was
in the habit of breaking up some of my larger copper rings
into little bits, and I was very pleased to find how far these
copper fragments would go in making purchases of skins of
various kinds. In this way I bought a fine otter skin (probably
<i lang="la">Lutra inunguis</i>, Cuv.) for about threepence, genet
skins for about a penny apiece, and those of the <i lang="la">Colobus
quereza</i> for a very little more. Very plentiful and consequently
equally cheap were the skins of civets, <i lang="la">Herpestes
fasciatus</i>, <i lang="la">Felis maniculata</i>, <i lang="la">F. caracal</i> and <i lang="la">F. serval</i>. The
skins of the smaller kinds of antelopes, too, were very
frequently offered for sale, especially those of the beautiful
<i lang="la">Antilope scripta</i> (the harness bush-bock of South Africa) and
of <i lang="la">A. grimmia</i>, <i lang="la">A. madoqua</i>, and the long-haired water-bock
(<i lang="la">A. difassa</i>). It is very strange how, notwithstanding this
extraordinary abundance and cheapness of skins, traffic in
them, as an article of commerce, is entirely unknown in
Khartoom, where the dealers seem to have no suspicion of
the large demand there undoubtedly would be. Leopard
skins, it may be added, were comparatively rare, and were
only used by royal personages to line their shields, or according
to their own special prerogative, to encircle their heads.
Nduppo wore a serval-skin, of which the ends drooped in
graceful folds over his neck and shoulders, whilst great pins,
headed with pieces cut from the tail of the <i lang="la">Sciurus leucumbrinus</i>,
held it firmly fastened to his luxuriant hair.</p>

<p>Aboo Sammat was known amongst the Niam-niam by the
name of “Mbahly” or “the little one,” a designation given
him long ago by the people, on account of the youthful age
at which he had entered their country. Nduppo informed
us that Wando had declared, with what was tantamount to
an oath, that Mbahly should not this time escape, but that
he and all his crew should be annihilated: he, moreover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
told us that the threats had extended to myself. Wando,
he said, avowed that he did not want any presents, and that
all the beads in the world were nothing to him; if any offerings
were sent he would trample them in the grass; if any
stuffs were given him he would rip them into shreds; plenty
of copper he had already, and for that matter, plenty of
ivory too, but he did not intend to part with any of it.</p>

<p>For a long time it perplexed me to discover the reason
of Wando’s animosity. Only two years previously he and
Mohammed had been on the most friendly terms. Mohammed
had visited him at his home, and the two had entered into
the closest alliance, which had been sealed by Mohammed
marrying his daughter, who as I have already mentioned,
was now one of the first ladies in the harem of Boiko. But,
meanwhile, Mohammed had been in Khartoom, and during
his absence he had entrusted the charge of his expeditions
to his brother, who had fallen out with Wando. Mutual
recriminations led to mutual plunder, and Wando was now
in a rage that could not easily be suppressed.</p>

<p>Nduppo led us to understand that in the course of our
next march we should receive definite tidings of Wando’s
intentions. If an attack were resolved upon, his whole force
would be assembled and we should be prevented from going
on to Rikkete; but if, on the other hand, we were permitted
to reach Rikkete unmolested we might then be sure that
there would be a temporary peace. And this in reality we
found to be the case. As we were approaching Rikkete we
were met by Wando’s envoys bringing the accustomed conciliatory
flasks of beer. Various circumstances might have
weighed with the chieftain to induce him to postpone his
outbreak. It is possible that he considered that while Aboo
Sammat’s and Ghattas’s companies were united and could
muster 300 guns, the time was not arrived for an attack; he
also reckoned, with true African craftiness, that it would be
more advantageous to himself to fall upon us on our way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
back from the Monbuttoo. He imagined, moreover, that
all our valuables which he now so contemptuously rejected
would fall into his hands without the necessity of any ivory
traffic at all, and that our stores (as being an unnecessary
burden to be carried to the Monbuttoo and back) would be
deposited in his charge until our return; and in addition
to all this, it is not unlikely that he counted with some
certainty upon receiving plenty of presents from the liberal
Kenoosian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRECAUTIONS.</div>

<p>In order to be ready in a moment for any emergency, our
caravan for the first time, on the 28th of February, set out
on its journey with its disposition arranged according to the
rules of Nubian warfare. The entire body being drawn out
in columns, the whole of the armed force was divided into
three companies, each headed by its own banner. In front
of all marched the first division of the troops, followed by
the bearers with the linen goods, the bars of copper, and the
store of beads; in the middle of the train was the second
division, which had charge of the bulk of the ammunition,
chests of cartridges and boxes of powder and caps; then
followed the women and female slaves, whilst the third
division brought up the rear. For the general security it
was ordered that no straggler should be permitted to lag
behind or to go farther back than the standard-bearer at the
head of the third division. From the nature of the path
all were obliged to march in single file, and thus our train,
although as compact as possible, swelled out to an enormous
length. Independently of the main body, a troop of native
soldiers, composed of Bongo and Niam-niam slaves, that
had been armed and well trained by Aboo Sammat, was
now detached to reconnoitre the thickets in front and on
either hand, and to make sure that the advance was safe.
As a general rule, these blacks made much more effective
soldiers than the Nubians, and upon them fell the heaviest
of all the work of war. Their employment of hunting, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>
is a pursuit much too laborious for their oppressors, makes
them far more expert and practised shots, and besides this,
they are heartier in their work and fear neither wind nor
weather.</p>

<p>Whilst all the Nubians who carry guns are dignified by the
high-sounding title of “Assaker” (soldiers), the natives who
may be enlisted are called in the common jargon of the
Soudan Arabic, either “Narakeek,” “Farookh” or “Bazingir.”
The precise etymology of these various designations
I could never ascertain. There are, however, some words
which occur so frequently in the conversation of the Khartoomers
that they become indispensable for fully describing
the details of service in the countries of the Upper Nile.
The “Narakeek,” for instance, would appear to be the
only men who are trusted with the heavier guns, of which
a considerable number, originally intended, no doubt, for
elephant-hunting, are now found in the companies of the
Khartoomers, and form what might be called their artillery.
Mohammed Aboo Sammat had twenty of these guns, of
which I ascertained that the majority were manufactured by
Roos of Stuttgard. They are not loaded either with conical
shot or with explosive bullets, but merely with a handful
of heavy deer-shot; their action is very effective, and their
first discharge amongst a party of savages rarely fails to
send them scampering off at full speed.</p>

<p>It was in crossing the beds of the brooks and in getting
through the thickets that bounded them that the greatest
precautions were requisite. All our long experience had
made us quite aware how easily a caravan may be thrown out
of marching order and put into the greatest confusion by the
mere irregularity of the soil, and under such circumstances
every attempt at defence must be unavailing: bullets might
do some service when deliberately aimed at an open foe, but
would be utterly useless when fired at random from amidst
a labyrinth of trees or in the obscurity of a thicket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMP-LIFE.</div>

<p>Between three and four hours were occupied in reaching
Rikkete’s mbanga. Half-way on our road, after crossing three
smaller streams, we came to a larger one, which, like the others
flowing to the south and to the east, passed near the hamlets
which lay contiguous to Nduppo’s frontier. Here we halted
for our morning meal. The bearers ransacked acre after
acre for the sweet-potatoes which were in cultivation in this
district, where also, for the first time in our descent from the
north, we found manioc plantations of any magnitude. Only
in deference to an express order that the poultry which was
running about the forsaken huts should be respected as the
property of others, did the people abstain from catching the
hens and chickens that were within their reach, but it was an
act of self-denial, and they were compelled to content themselves
with plantains cooked in ashes. Altogether it was a
motley picture of African camp-life: the ravaged lands, the
chattels of the fugitives scattered all around, the variety of
platters, the corn-bins, the wooden mortars, the stools, the
mats, and the baskets, all tumbled about at the pleasure of
the intruders, conspired to make a spectacle of confusion
so utter and so hopeless that, the only relief was in resignation.</p>

<p>Beyond the stream our path turned directly to the south;
hitherto its direction, though winding, had been mainly
west. The continual fluctuations in the level of the land
made me suspect that we were really approaching that
watershed of the Nile for which I had been looking with
such eager and impatient expectation. The ground, that had
been sloping down towards the west all the way to Nduppo’s
mbanga, we now found sloping down towards the east, so that
the streams that proceeded from this district to meet the
Yubbo for a while flowed in a direction exactly opposite to
that of the stream they were about to join. A comparatively
important stream, the Lindukoo, at a little distance received
all these other streams into its channel and was the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
water connected with the system of the Nile that we
had to cross. Over steepish hills, along defiles of slippery
clay and through clefts and ravines which the rain-torrents
had capriciously hollowed out, our road led us onward to
Rikkete. Contrary to our expectations we were received
amidst the mingled noise of drum and trumpet, whilst a
deputy from the chieftain stood in front of his huts to bid
us welcome.</p>

<p>We encamped upon some ground that was still fallow, for
the few showers that had fallen were only the forerunners of
the settled rain which lasts from May till October, and had
had little effect upon the soil, so that the sowing of the
crops had not yet commenced. Our camp was close to some
groups of huts that were inhabited by Rikkete’s wives and
retinue; and behind it, under the shadow of imposing banks,
flowed a brook called the Atazilly.</p>

<p>Mohammed entered into very amicable relations with
Rikkete, and not only obtained some valuable tusks from
him by way of traffic, but secured an ample supply of provisions
for the immediate use of the caravan. Towards
evening some messengers arrived from Wando, confirming
his friendly intentions and bringing, as peaceful pledges, an
offering of flasks of eleusine-beer. At night we were in company
with Rikkete, and Riharn my cook, who had but few
opportunities of displaying that skill in the culinary art
which he prided himself upon learning in the large hotel at
Cairo, prepared some farinaceous dish in the European style
with which I entertained the Niam-niam magnate. The
article that seemed to puzzle the people most was our sugar;
they could not comprehend how it should have all the appearance
of stone and yet melted in the mouth, tasting like the
juice of their native sugar-cane, which was cultivated among
them, although not to any great extent.</p>

<p>Before tasting the proffered beer, Mohammed insisted upon
Wando’s emissaries emptying one gourd-shell after another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
for their own enjoyment, a proceeding which had the effect
of considerably elevating the spirits of the party. The
Nubian soldiers, pleased at the pacific turn that matters had
taken, passed the night in chanting their carols, accompanied
by the strains of the tarabuka; and the Bongo and Mittoo
revelled and danced for many hours in their own fashion to
the sound of their kettle-drums and horns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIVISION OF THE FORCE.</div>

<p>There seemed now to remain no further obstacle in the
way of the separation of the two companies; and, in order to
complete the preliminary arrangements for the division, it
was decided that we must remain for a whole day with
Rikkete, a determination which was hailed by myself with
much satisfaction. Ghattas’s corps was to be accompanied
by a detachment of one hundred of Aboo Sammat’s soldiers,
and to take its departure for what formerly had been
Keefa’s territories in the west and south-west, where they
hoped to transact a remunerative business, because, in consequence
of the absconding of the natives, the main company
of Ghattas had been left destitute of any bearers. After the
reduction, an armed force of 175 was left for our protection
as we proceeded on the remainder of our way to the
Monbuttoo.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning I paid Rikkete a visit at
his residence in the village, and made him what I considered
a handsome present of beads of a pattern superior to what
had ever before been seen in this part of Africa. I, however,
received no present in return, but on the contrary
had to pay for the simplest things with which I was
supplied, whether they were sweet-potatoes, colocasiæ, or
poultry. The Niam-niam are an acquisitive people, and
never lose an opportunity to increase their store of copper,
attaching comparatively little importance to any other wealth.
Once when I was complaining that in spite of my liberality
I could not obtain the most trifling articles for cooking without
giving a full price for them, I was met by the true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
African answer that if they took the trouble to bring me
their commodities I must expect to pay for them.</p>

<p>My visit to Rikkete over, I could not resist spending the
day of our halt in an excursion. Accordingly, having enlisted
the services of some natives as guides, I started off with all
my people, who had to carry my heterogeneous appliances,
which consisted of guns, portfolios, boxes large and small, cases,
ropes, trowels, stock-shears and hoes. Crossing the Atazilly,
and wading by the side of the stream through the swamps
which were crowded with jungles of amomum as high as
myself, and adorned with the rosy blossoms of the <i lang="la">Melastomaceæ</i>,
I proceeded for three-quarters of a league across the
steppe until I reached the stream to which I have referred
already, called the Lindukoo or the Undukoo.</p>

<p>Here there opened to my view one of the most magnificent
prospects that forest scenery could afford; the gigantic
measure of some of the trees was altogether surprising, but
yet, on account their various heights, their foliage lay as it
were in strata, and the denseness of the ramification wove
the branches into a chaos as picturesque as it was inextricable.
A merry world of apes was gambolling on the topmost
boughs; two of the larger species of monkeys (<i lang="la">Cercopithecus</i>)
were also represented, as well as members of the <i>Galago</i>
family, which are half-blinded by the glare of daylight. The
<i>Colobi</i>, too, with their long silvery hair, were conspicuous as
they flitted across the dark gaps that were left in the lower
branches, or as they scampered along the more horizontal
arms of the trees above. Numerous, however, as they were,
I had no chance of securing a single specimen, as my shot,
when aimed to an altitude of seventy or eighty feet, was spent
in vain. The guinea-fowl, as ever, afforded prolific sport,
their large grey bodies standing out distinctly against the
fresh verdure; but we lost a great many that were hit, in
consequence of their falling into the midst of impenetrable
masses of shrubs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
Accompanied as I was by only a small number of armed
men, I could not be otherwise than sensible how completely,
if they chose, I was in the power of the natives. I was
encouraged, however, to believe that the engagement made
was perfectly reliable, as, except under that conviction, consent
would never have been given for the armed forces to
divide.</p>

<p>My Niam-niam guides rendered me the greatest service;
not only did they enter very heartily into my pursuits,
climbing up the lofty trees without hesitation to reach the
produce of the topmost boughs, but they made me acquainted
with the native names of all the plants, and brought me
specimens for my close inspection of what otherwise I could
merely see at a distance, and in the confusion of promiscuous
foliage.</p>

<p>Though the hollow gorge of the river sank for some eighty
feet, there were trees at the bottom whose crests were level
with the land above. The protruding roots amid the landslips,
just as in our own mountain hollows, served as steps;
and all along, abundant as in Alpine clefts, there sprung up
many a variety of graceful ferns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RIKKETE’S WIVES.</div>

<p>I proceeded north-west for a considerable distance up the
stream, and having laboriously crossed and recrossed the
swampy bed of the valley, I returned in the evening to my
quarters with my portfolios enriched beyond my most sanguine
expectations. Before night, I repeated my visit to
Rikkete’s residence, and found his wives sitting on the open
area before the huts, and employed in their several domestic
ways. My intrusion appeared to give the ladies great uneasiness,
and the interpreters themselves put on a grave look of
concern and were ominously silent. I was just about to
transfer the scene to my sketch-book when Rikkete suddenly
appeared. He reproached me vigorously, insisted upon
knowing what business I had amongst his wives, and demanded
how I presumed to go to his huts without his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
knowledge or permission. These Niam-niam wives for their
part were very passive, and as quiet and reserved as though
they had been brought up amidst the refinements of a Turkish
harem. Rikkete, too, was soon appeased. He was a true
son of the desert; but his general demeanour, the reserve of
his bearing, and the moderation of his tone, were worthy of
him as a man of royal blood who, conscious of his superiority,
could, when he pleased, converse with the most perfect self-possession.</p>

<p>In my subsequent transactions with the natives, I was
again offered a great number of skins; this time skins of
genets, which were represented in several varieties. I discriminated
them into three sorts, according to the number of
the stripes made by the spots that ran along the body. The
general colour appeared to change with the creatures’ age.
The ground colour varied from a light ash-grey to a deep
yellowish brown, while the spots ranged from the colour of
coffee to a perfect black. In consequence of these diversities
zoologists have very probably been misled, and have been
all in error when they have described the <i lang="la">Viverra genetta</i> as
being of several species.</p>

<p>In the glimmer of dawn we were aroused by the accustomed
signals. Two of the Bongo in Mohammed’s service
had learnt at Khartoom how to blow their trumpets and beat
their drums for this important function, and they sounded
the Turkish <i lang="fr">réveil</i> admirably, giving it the full roll and
proper compass. In particular, Inglery the trumpeter was
superb in his execution, and the astonished woods could not
too often re-echo back his clanging notes. The Niam-niam
were quite delighted with the strain, and frequently could be
detected humming the melody to themselves. Wando and
Munza alike were never weary of urging the request that
Aboo Sammat would either make them a present of his
trumpeter, or allow them to purchase him at any price he
might elect to name; but Inglery was the joy and pride of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>
Mohammed, and in his way was quite unique throughout the
district of the Upper Nile as far as the banner of Islam had
been borne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIAM-NIAM DIGNITY.</div>

<p>Our caravan was accompanied by a large number of guides
and natives who were eager to show the way, as a stiff day’s
march was before us, and a passage over several difficult
water-courses had to be accomplished. The morning toilette
of the Niam-niam guides was singular enough. In order to
protect themselves against the chilly damp of the early dew
as they marched along the narrow pathways of the steppes,
they covered the entire front of their body with some large
skins, which made them look as if they wore coopers’ aprons.
For this purpose there is no skin that looks more picturesque
than that of the bush-bock, with its rows of white spots and
stripes upon a yellow ochre ground. The bearing of the
Niam-niam is always chivalrous as becomes a people devoted
to war and to the chase, exhibiting a very strong contrast to
the unpolished nonchalance of the Bongo, the Mittoo, and
even of the finicking Arabians. The Niam-niam might be
introduced straight upon the stage, and would be faultless in
the symmetry with which they would go through their poses.</p>

<p>Our way took a turn beyond the Atazilly across the same
steppe over which we had passed yesterday. After an hour
we arrived again at the Lindukoo, which here forms a considerable
cataract of some thirty feet deep, falling over the
worn and polished gneiss. A thick bank-wood shaded the
rocks, which were charmingly adorned with the rarest ferns,
and a regular jungle of tangled foliage canopied the depth
beneath which the rosy blooming ginger-bushes grew as tall
as a man and scented the air with their fine aroma. Just for
half-an-hour we halted upon the high and dry levels that
we found, and regaled ourselves with refreshment from our
store of provisions.</p>

<p>An early rest like this was quite common with us, for in
the confusion of our starting at the dawn of day there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
seldom any leisure at all to think of breakfast. Our leader,
neither proud nor upstart, but like all Nubians, whose finest
quality is their sense of equity and brotherhood, munched
away amidst a circle of his more intimate associates, to which
my Khartoom attendants were admitted, at some cold fowl
seasoned with pimento, which was the choicest morsel that the
country could supply. With the flowery yams, the sweet-potatoes,
and the colocasiæ, which appeared such an invaluable
boon to the country, the Nubians could do nothing, so unaccustomed
were they in their native place to vegetables of any
sort: what they missed most was plenty of their flat cake of
kissere; quite voluntarily they renounced all meat. They
carried with them a supply of the capsules of the <i lang="la">Hibiscus
esculentus</i>, dried before they were ripe, and by the aid of the
indispensable red pepper and some fat or oily substance, they
manufactured a slimy sauce in which they soused their kissere.
They were epicures enough to carry with them in a horn
their own “duggoo,” which is a kind of pot-pourri composed
of every condiment they can procure, being a combination of
salt, pimento, fœnum græcum, basilicum, coriander, mustard,
dill, and a variety of other ingredients of the kind.</p>

<p>But now for a time the days of kissere and sorghum-pap
were over. Now for awhile they had to put up with eleusine,
that tiny, scaly, black and bitter grain of which Speke
declares that it is sown, because the spades, which do such an
amount of mischief to other seeds, leave this uninjured—&#8203;the
same <i lang="la">Eleusine coracana</i> (called teleboon in Arabic and raggi
in the West Indies) which on account of its extreme bitterness
was condemned by Baker as being putrid and unfit to
eat. Leaving it for the people who seemed to enjoy it well
enough, he made the remark that “the lion dies of hunger
where the ass grows fat.”</p>

<p>There was a general belief in magic. One day, my
servant, Mohammed Ameen, would get it into his head that I
had found a plant from which I could extract gold; on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>
next day it would be some wonderful skull that I had found,
and from which I knew how to extract the subtlest poison;
the day after and I had the luck to kill an antelope because
I was in possession of some marvellous root. With plain
matter-of-fact these good people cannot get on at all: that
every herb must have some medicinal properties and use
would appear never to have entered the minds of any but
Europeans. “Knowest thou the herb that gives perpetual
youth?” is the question that the Oriental asks; and mysterious
secrets are yet to be unfolded to the African.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FATALISM.</div>

<p>No one clings more than a Niam-niam to the superstition
that the possession of certain charmed roots contributes to
the success of the chase, so that the best shots, when they
have killed an unusual number either of antelopes or buffaloes
are usually credited with having such roots in their
keeping. The fatalism, which is exhibited just as decidedly
by Mohammedans as by heathens, is such that it does not
attach the least importance to the skill with which an arrow
or bullet is aimed. This is a reason why the Khartoomers
are never practised in the art of shooting; they do not doubt
but that whatever is designed for the unbeliever is sure to
hit its mark.</p>

<p>The direction which the river Lindukoo was taking
appeared to me to be exactly the reverse of that in which
flowed the current of the Yubbo; and, in spite of the positiveness
on the part of the guides, all their statements left my
mind unconvinced, and in a state of considerable perplexity.
But two months later when I had again to cross the river some
distance further to the East, my presentiment was thoroughly
confirmed. The formation of the land just here is very
uneven and irregular; quite in contrast to what it was
observed to be both previously and subsequently upon our
progress. With the Lindukoo, then, I was bidding farewell
to the district of the Nile. Many as there had been before
who had undertaken to explore the mighty river to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
fountain-head, here was I, the first European coming from the
north who yet had ever traversed.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Watershed of the Nile</span>.</p>

<p>Upon this memorable day in my life, I confess I had no
real knowledge of the significance of the soil upon which my
steps were tarrying, for as yet I could know nothing of the
configuration of the country before us. The revelation of the
truth about this watershed only became apparent to me after
I had gathered and weighed the testimony of the Niam-niam,
which sufficiently demonstrated that the next river, the
Mbrwole, belongs to the system of the Welle. This river
<em>now</em> was an enigma to me, and to unravel the hydrographical
perplexities which surrounded it, continued throughout my
journey to puzzle my brain; certainly I was satisfied it could
never be brought into unison with any of the tributaries of
the Sway. A little patience, and the problem was solved.</p>

<p>With the exception of the high ridge on the north of the
River Lehssy which the Niam-niam call Mbala Ngeea, there
was nowhere, along the entire line from the Gazelle to the
Welle, any wide difference observable in the conformation of
the land. But southwards from the Lindukoo, it was all
uphill and downhill, and through defiles, hill-caps rising and
falling on either side, high enough to be prominent over the
undulations that were around them. These undulations were
everywhere of that red hue which rendered it all but certain
that they were only elevations of that crust of recent swamp-ore
which is so widely diffused in Central Africa. The
higher eminences that rose above were of a far earlier
formation, being projections of gneiss, the weather-worn
remnants of some primeval mountain ranges, gnawed by the
tooth of time, and crumbled down from jagged peaks to
smooth and rounded caps. Subsequently, on my return at
the end of April, I pushed my way beyond these elevations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
of the gneiss, and penetrated farther east, into the narrower
limits of the watershed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUTABILITY OF RIVER CHANNELS.</div>

<p>This uniformity in geological formation of a district so
immense, as far as it is known, is certainly very remarkable.
The source of the Dyoor is the only exception, and presents
some variety in stratification. Everything points to the
fact that since the era of the formation of the swamp-ore
(spreading as it does from the banks of the Dyoor to the
Coanza, and from Mozambique to the Niger) there has been
no alteration in the surface condition of the land except
what has occurred by reason of the water-courses finding
new directions for themselves along the loose and yielding
deposit. And even when the elevations are taken into
account which have caused whole chains of hills to arise,
such for instance as those which encircle the basin of the
Tondy, still I am inclined to believe that there too the
existence of the valleys and depressions is to be explained
by no other hypothesis than the perpetual mutability of the
channels by which the streams have forced their way.</p>

<p>Followed in our course from the Lindukoo by a side
stream which discharged itself by a waterfall, we arrived
at the regular watershed, which, judging by my aneroid,
which had not varied for four years, I should estimate at
3000 feet high. Passing onwards we came to a brook called
the Naporruporroo which rippled through a gorge some
seventy feet deep. The stem of a great tree had been
thrown across the chasm, and by means of this we were
enabled to pass over without being under the necessity of
making a descent. As we proceeded, the peaks of the trees
which grew beneath were some way below the level of our
feet. After a while, we had first to cross another, and then
another of these streams which at no great distance united
themselves in one common channel.</p>

<p>The stream I have just mentioned was at the bottom of a
valley some eighty feet deep, and as its banks were almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>
perpendicular the bearers had to make the most strenuous
exertions to ascend. They had to help each other up, and
the baggage therefore had to be passed on from one to
another of the men, and then to be laid down awhile that
they might have their hands at liberty to help them as they
climbed. To accomplish this difficult passage at all with
four-footed beasts of burden it would have been requisite
to make a very long and arduous <i lang="fr">détour</i>. The detention,
however, to which the difficulty subjected the caravan was
not in any way a loss to me; it gave me time to stay and
gather up what I would of the botanical treasures of the
place, which in luxuriance seemed to me to surpass all that
as yet I had seen. The valley was so deep that no ray of
sunshine by any possibility could enter it. The pathway
was barely a foot wide and wound itself through a mass of
waving foliage. There was a kind of Brillantaisia with
large violet blossoms that I found close by the way; and I
stayed to arrange in my portfolio, for future investigation,
some of its leaves, waiting while our lengthy procession
passed along. Squeezed up in a labyrinth of boughs and
creepers, and wreathed about with leaves, I sat as though I
were in a nest. These opportunities were several times
repeated, in which I found I could get half an hour at my
disposal, and could botanize without disturbance; then as
soon as the caravan had defiled past I took advantage of the
first open ground to regain my position near the front.</p>

<p>So numerous were the hindrances and so great the
obstacles which arose from the ground conformation of the
watershed that our progress was necessarily slow.</p>

<p>About four miles from Lindukoo we reached the Mbrwole,
which the Nubians without further description simply call
“Wando’s River.” It was here bordered by wood, and
had a breadth of about eighty feet, though its depth did not
exceed two feet, the flow of the stream being what might be
described as torpid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
Aboo Sammat’s people gave us all the particulars of the
year’s luck in hunting, and dwelt much upon the circumstance
of a chimpanzee having been killed, an event which
was evidently very unusual. The woods that composed the
“galleries” were dense and manifestly adapted to be a resort
of these creatures. The fact was of considerable interest
as relating to the watershed, because in none of the more
northerly woods had I ever been able to acquire any evidence
at all that the chimpanzee had been known to exist. It
was remarkable that the first trace I found of this race of
animals was upon my reaching the first river that was unattached
to the system of the Nile. It may be said of the
district of Wando, where bank vegetation is most luxuriant
and where the drainage is like a complication of veins
squeezed from an overcharged sponge, that it is the region
which, more than any other, is conspicuous for the abundance
of the chimpanzee, which here represents the breed of the
West African <i lang="la">Troglodytes niger</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANONACEÆ.</div>

<p>Countless in diversity as were the trees and shrubs, the
<i lang="la">Anonaceæ</i>, by mere reason of their numbers, must take a
very prominent place in the catalogue. A family of plants
is this of which, so long as the flora of tropical Africa was
unexplored, it was presumed that America was the chief, if
not the exclusive habitat. But since our knowledge has
been enlarged, and especially since my own investigations in
the Niam-niam lands, it has become clear almost beyond a
question that Africa is at least as prodigal in the Anonaceæ
that it yields as all the tropical districts of America.</p>

<p>Again for two hours we made a pause. The Nubians
enjoyed a bright cool bath, the long column of bearers still
toiling onwards with their loads. The opportunity to myself
was as acceptable as ever, and I continued to secure a new
abundance of botanical treasure. By way of variety, intelligence
was brought us that a gun had gone off through
negligence, and that the ball had rent a hole in the apron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
of one of the soldiers. Of course there was a great outcry
and no end of gesticulating. The culprit took with the most
passive resignation the lashing that was assigned him, and
then all was forgotten, and something fresh had to be awaited
to stir up a new excitement. The people are fatalists of the
purest water, and no amount of experience can make them
prudent.</p>

<p>Farther on, a march through a flat and open steppe led us
after a few miles to a deep glen so thick with wood that it
occupied us at least half an hour in crossing. Its bottom
was a wide marshy streak over which there was no movement
of the water, that seemed to be entirely stagnant. A
new type of vegetation revealed itself, one never observed in
the Nile lands by any previous traveller. This consisted of
the thickets of Pandanus, which were to my mind an evidence
of our having entered upon a new river-district altogether,
the plant being an undoubted representative of the flora of
the western coast.</p>

<p>And now we had to make our first experience of the
various artifices by which the transit over these marshes has
to be accomplished; not only would it be impossible for a
carriage of any description or for any one on horseback to go
over, but even when the baggage was conveyed by hand
there was the serious risk of anyone seeing all that he most
cared for, his clothes and his journals, tumbling from the
bearers’ heads and sinking in the filthy slime. Mouldering
trunks of trees there might be, but to place the foot upon
these was to find them roll like a wave in the waters; others
would be too smooth and slippery to allow a step to be
trusted to their treacherous support; and then the deep
continual holes would either be filled by water or covered
with a floating vegetation which betrayed the unwary footsteps
into trouble, so that there was no alternative for the
bearers but to jump from mound to mound and keep their
balance as best they might: to no purpose would they try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
to grasp at some support; the prickly leaves of the Pandanus,
notched and jagged on the edges as a saw, made them
glad to withdraw their tortured hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROSSING THE MARSHES.</div>

<p>For miles far away the deserts re-echoed back the shouts
of the bearers as they splashed through the waters; and the
air around reverberated with the outcry, with the mingled
laughing and swearing of the Nubians, and with the fluster
of the women slaves as they jostled each other in carrying
their dishes, gourd-flasks, and calabashes, through the prickly
hedges. Every now and then would arise a general shriek,
half in merriment, half in fright, from a hundred lungs,
betokening that some unlucky slave had plumped down into
a muddy hole, and that all her cooking utensils had come
tumbling after. I could not help being on continual tenterhooks
as to the fate which would befal my own baggage,
particularly my herbarium, which although it was packed
up most cautiously in india-rubber, yet required to be
handled very gently. My Bongo bearers, however, were
picked men, and did their work well. They waded on and
never once had any misadventure, so that it resulted that
everything, without exception, that I had gathered in these
remote districts of Central Africa, was spared alike from loss
or damage.</p>

<p>Dressing and undressing on these occasions was tiresome
enough, but it was not the whole of the inconvenience.
When the task of getting across had been accomplished,
there still remained the business of purification; and no
easy matter was it to get free from the black mud and slime
that adhered tenaciously to the skin. It almost seemed as
if Africa herself had been roused to spitefulness, and was
exhibiting her wrath against the intruder who presumed to
meddle with her secrets. With a malicious glee she appeared
to be exulting that she was able to render the white
man, at least for the time, as black as any of her own
children; nor was she content till she had sent a plague of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>
mud-leeches to add to his discomfort. Naked and shivering
she let him stand even in the mist and rain of a chilly dawn;
and no help for him till some friendly hand should guide
him to a pool where the water still was undefiled, and he
could get a wash. And then what a scraping! How ruefully
too would his eye fall upon the ugly blood-suckers which
clung about his legs! To make these relax their hold,
recourse must be had to the powder-flask; and, after all, the
clothes would be saturated with the blood that had been
shed in vain. As for the things that had been splashed and
wetted in the turmoil of the passage, they were laid out
either upon a cluster of trampled fern-leaves or upon any
little spot that seemed to give them a chance of drying.</p>

<p>The sun was already declining, and we had still three of
these bogs to pass over, each with its running stream that
would delay us for half an hour or more. Of these three,
the second was the largest, and was known by the name of
Mbangoh. Notwithstanding the vexation and harassment,
to which I was unaccustomed, I found many an opportunity
of gathering shrubs and plants of interest from the promiscuous
vegetation amidst which we made our way.</p>

<p>The shades of night had gathered, when, after passing the
last of the rivulets, we arrived at some farms in a cultivated
spot. There was indication of rain, and a great deal of
commotion ensued in taking precaution against it; luckily,
however, we escaped with only a few heavy drops, and
having been relieved from anxiety by a general clearing of
the weather, we enjoyed the good night’s rest which our
hard day’s toil had earned.</p>

<p>In order that we might arrive at Wando’s residence in
good time on the following day, we made our start punctually
at sunrise. After we had marched for half a league over
open steppe, and had effected our passage over the Dyagbe,
the signal was sounded for the morning halt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOO SAMMAT’S INTERVIEW WITH WANDO.</div>

<p>Mohammed here expressed his intention of having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span>
preliminary conference with Wando before we definitively
pitched our camp, and borrowing my revolver, as he had
done before, he set out with the utmost composure, attended
solely by his black body-guard, the Farookh. At the head
of these he hurried away at a pace so fast that the lads who
carried his arms could scarcely keep up with him. It is
characteristic of the Nubians that whenever they have important
transactions on hand they always move with extreme
rapidity.</p>

<p>Within an hour Mohammed returned, perfectly content
with his interview, and proceeded at once to conduct the
caravan to the station allotted to it, close to the banks of
the Dyagbe, and just about the distance of an arrowshot
from the wall of foliage which formed the confine of the
primeval forest. Taking their hatchets, the bearers entered
the thickets and hewed down long stakes, with which they
set to work to construct some huts, my own people meanwhile
busying themselves by providing some posts and props
which I required equally for the protection of my baggage
from the dampness of the ground and for placing it out of
the reach of white ants. I had brought some deal boards
with me from Khartoom, and by putting these upon the
props a convenient arrangement was made for storing in
the narrowest compass a good deal of baggage. Space in my
tent was necessarily very limited.</p>

<p>Every hand was set to work, and in a very short time a
number of pretty little huts were erected with no other
material than the fresh grass; and when the baggage had
all been properly secured there commenced a brisk and very
amicable commerce with the natives. Fine elephant-tusks
were brought for sale, and found no lack of ready purchasers.
Presents of cloth and beads were freely distributed, for the
double purpose of putting the people into a good mood and of
inducing them to disclose new resources for procuring ivory.
Wando himself appeared arrayed in a large shirt of figured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
calico, made with long sleeves, which he wore (in the same
way as all the other native chieftains) solely out of compliment
to the donor. As soon as the visitors withdrew he
deemed it an attire below his dignity, and could not condescend
to trick himself out in a dress which ordinarily was
reserved as a kind of curiosity for his wardrobe.</p>

<p>The cannibal prince, of whom for some days we had been
in such dread, looked a harmless mortal enough as he
strolled through the camp arm-in-arm with Mohammed’s
officers; no doubt they had enjoyed a mutual drink to each
other’s health.</p>

<p>The kind of beads which the Niam-niam prefer wearing,
when they can procure them, is that which is known in
Khartoom commerce as “mandyoor,” consisting of a long
polyhedral prism, about as large as a bean and blue as lapis
lazuli. Hardly any other kind retains any value at all.
Cowries are still used as a decoration on the national costume,
but the demand for them is not great, and for ten years
past they have not formed at all an important item in the
Khartoom traffic. Fashion extends its sway even as far as
these remote wildernesses, which have their own special
demand for “novelties.”</p>

<p>As medium of exchange, nothing here was of any value
except copper and iron, which never failed to be accepted in
payment. English copper, which the Khartoomers take with
them in long bars about three-quarters of an inch thick, is most
in repute; but not unfrequently they make use of the lumps
of copper which they obtain from the mines to the south of
Darfoor. With any other resources for obtaining copper the
inhabitants of the country through which I travelled appear
to be hardly acquainted, though possibly the Congo region
might, in former times, have found an outlet for its store in
this direction. To provide suitable small change for their
minor purchases, the expeditions to the Niam-niam always
include among their bearers a certain number of smiths, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>
from the larger bars and ingots fabricate rings of all sizes,
from the circlet to go round the arm down to the ring just
large enough to fit the finger. These rings are made from
quadrangular bars, the ends of which are subsequently
reduced to taper points. It may be added, by way of
example, that for a finger ring a Niam-niam would give a
chicken, although the copper material itself was not worth
three farthings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COST OF IVORY.</div>

<p>Here, at its fountain-head, ivory, as might naturally be
expected, may be obtained in barter at a very trifling cost.
On the coast of Guinea it is necessary to part with a whole
host of commodities, guns, cloth, knives, looking-glasses, and
what not, for a single tusk of an elephant; but a Niam-niam
is contented if he can get half a bar of copper, which would
not be worth more than four or five dollars. Not only, however,
would there be some additional presents of cloth or
beads, but the weight and transport would have to be taken
into account. The prime cost here would probably be scarcely
five per cent. of the value of the ivory, which fluctuating,
of course, according to quality, generally, on an average, in
Europe realises two or three dollars a pound; whilst on the
other hand, the same purchase could not be made at the harbours
upon the western coasts for much less than 80 per cent.
of the gross value. Through the immense outlay which is
entailed upon the Khartoom merchants by the support of so
many soldiers, and, in fact, from the precarious results of the
expeditions, the ultimate profit is really so moderate and it
is gained at so much risk, that the ivory trade on the whole
is not flourishing. But how matters could practically be
mended, or how the expenses of proceeding in the lands of
the Upper Nile could be diminished, I confess I have no
scheme to propose. The lands are not only so remote from
the coast, but they are so far away even from the navigable
rivers, that they can never play an important part in the
traffic of the world; nor can the railway which it is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
contemplation to construct between Khartoom and Egypt
introduce any material change into the existing condition of
things.</p>

<p>So full of bustle was our camp life that it was not till
nightfall that I had an opportunity of inquiring from Mohammed
what had transpired during his interview with
Wando. I now learnt that the revolver he had borrowed
had done him a good turn. He had hurried on in front of
his escort, and had gone boldly to the chieftain to reprimand
him for his equivocal behaviour; but he had no sooner
entered the hut than he was encircled by a troop of Wando’s
satellites, who levelled their lances at him in a most
threatening attitude. He felt himself a prisoner, but, undismayed,
he cried out that his life should cost them a thousand
lives, and, snapping the revolver, he dared them to touch
him at their peril. The intimidated Niam-niam at once
assumed a milder tone, and, thanks, as Mohammed said, to
his temerity, everything turned out well.</p>

<p>We remained in Wando’s camp from the 2nd to the 6th
of March. The wood at Dyagbe was most luxuriant, and
every day it unlocked to me new and untold treasures, which
were a permanent delight. Here, too, was unfolded before
my gaze the full glory of what we shall in future understand
as “a gallery.”</p>

<p>My predecessor, the Italian Piaggia, whose meagre description
of the Niam-niam lands betrays, in spite of all, an acute
power of observation, has designated these tracts of bank
vegetation as “galleries.” The expression seems to me so
appropriate and significant that I cannot help wishing it
might be generally adopted. I will endeavour briefly to
state in what the peculiarities of these “galleries” consist.</p>

<p>In a way that answers precisely to the description which
Dr. Livingstone in his last accounts has given of the country to
the west of Lake Tanganyika, and which is not adequately
accounted for either by the geological aspect of the region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>
or by any presumed excess of rain, there is sometimes found
a numerical aggregate of springs which is beyond precedent.
These springs result in a perpetual waterflow, which in the
north would all be swallowed up by the thirsty soil of low
and open plains, but which here in the Niam-niam country
is all restrained within deep-cut channels that form, as it
were, walls to confine the rippling stream. The whole
country, which is nowhere less than 2000 feet above the
level of the sea, is like an over-full sponge. The consequence
of this is, that many plants which in the north disappear
as soon as the fall of the waters deprives them of
their moisture, are here found flourishing all the year round;
so that all the vales and chinks through which the water
makes its way are permanently adorned with a tropical luxuriance.
The variety of trees and the manifold developments
of the undergrowth conspire to present a spectacle charming
as any that could be seen upon the coast of Guinea or in the
countries which are watered by the lower Niger. But, notwithstanding
all this, the vegetation altogether retains its
own specific character up in the higher tracts between stream
and stream, and corresponds to what we have been familiar
with ever since we put our foot upon the red soil of Bongoland,
being a park-like wood, of which the most conspicuous
feature is the magnitude of the leaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUALISM OF VEGETATION.</div>

<p>I have previously had occasion to mention how a dualism
of the same kind marked the vegetation of the whole country
south of the Hoo, where the formation of the land first changed
from the monotonous alternations between low grass flats and
undulated wood-terraces. It would almost seem as if the
reason for the altered law which presides over the water-courses
is to be sought in the increasing elevation of the soil, and
in the opening of the lower plain of the swamp-ore, which,
being furrowed up with a multitude of channels, allows the
unfailing supply of all the numerous springs to flow away.</p>

<p>Trees with immense stems, and of a height surpassing all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span>
that we had elsewhere seen (not even excepting the palms of
Egypt), here stood in masses which seemed unbounded except
where at intervals some less towering forms rose gradually
higher and higher beneath their shade. In the innermost
recesses of these woods one would come upon an avenue like
the colonnade of an Egyptian temple, veiled in the leafy
shade of a triple roof above. Seen from without, they had
all the appearance of impenetrable forests, but, traversed
within, they opened into aisles and corridors which were
musical with many a murmuring fount.</p>

<p>Hardly anywhere was the height of these woods less than
70 feet, and on an average it was much nearer 100; yet,
viewed from without, they very often failed to present anything
of that imposing sight which was always so captivating
when taken from the brinks of the brooks within. In some
places the sinking of the ground along which the gallery-tunnels
ran would be so great that not half the wood revealed
itself at all to the contiguous steppes, while in that wood (out
of sight as it was) many a “gallery” might still exist.</p>

<p>Most of those gigantic trees, the size of the stems of which
exceed any of our own venerable monarchs of the woods,
belong to the class either of the <i lang="la">Sterculiæ</i> or the <i lang="la">Boswelliæ</i>, to
which perhaps may be added that of the <i lang="la">Cæsalpiniæ</i>; the
numerous Fig-trees, the <i lang="la">Artocarpeæ</i>, the <i lang="la">Euphorbiaceæ</i>, and
the endless varieties of the <i lang="la">Rubiaceæ</i>, must be entirely
excluded from that category, and few representatives of
this grade belong to the region of the underwood. Amongst
the plants of second and third rank there were many of
the large-leaved varieties, and the figs again, as well as
the <i lang="la">Papilionaceæ</i> and especially the <i lang="la">Rubiaceæ</i> had an
important place to fill. There was no lack of thorny
shrubberies; and the <i lang="la">Oncoba</i>, the <i lang="la">Phyllanthus</i>, the <i lang="la">Celastrus</i>,
and the <i lang="la">Acacia ataxacantha</i>, cluster after cluster,
were met with in abundance. Thick creepers climbed
from bough to bough, the <i lang="la">Modecca</i> being the most prominent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
of all; but the <i lang="la">Cissus</i> with its purple leaf, the
<i lang="la">Coccinea</i>, the prickly <i lang="la">Smilax</i>, the <i lang="la">Helmiæ</i>, and the <i lang="la">Dioscoreæ</i>
all had their part to play. Made up of these, the whole
underwood spread out its ample ramifications, its green twilight
made more complete by the thickness of the substance
of the leaves themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERNS.</div>

<p>Down upon the very ground, again, there were masses, all
but impenetrable, of plants of many and many a variety
which contributed to fill up every gap that was left in this
mazy labyrinth of foliage. First of all there were the extensive
jungles of the <i lang="la">Amoma</i> and the <i lang="la">Costus</i> rising full fifteen
feet high, and of which the rigid stems (like the haulms of
the towering grass) either bar out the progress of a traveller
altogether or admit him, if he venture to force his way
among them, only to fall into the sloughs of muddy slime
from which they grow. And then there was the marvellous
world of ferns destitute indeed of stems, but running in their
foliage to some twelve feet high. Boundless in the variety of
the feathery articulations of their fronds, some of them seemed
to perform the graceful part of throwing a veil over the
treasures of the wood; and others lent a charming contrast
to the general uniformity of the leafy scene. High above
these there worked themselves the large slim-stemmed
<i lang="la">Rubiaceæ</i> (<i lang="la">Coffeæ</i>), which by regularity of growth and symmetry
of leaf appeared to imitate, and in a measure to supply
the absence of, the arboraceous ferns. Of all other ferns the
most singular that I observed was that which I call the elephant’s
ear. This I found up in trees at a height of more
than 50 feet, in association with the <i lang="la">Angræca</i> and the long
grey barb of the hanging <i lang="la">Usneæ</i>.</p>

<p>Whenever the stems of the trees failed to be thickly overgrown
by some of these different ferns, they were rarely
wanting in garlands of the crimson-berried pepper which
twined themselves around. Far as the eye could reach it
rested solely upon green which did not admit a gap. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span>
narrow paths that wound themselves partly through and
partly around the growing thickets were formed by steps
consisting of bare and protruding roots which retained the
light loose soil together. Mouldering stems, thickly clad
with moss, obstructed the passage at well-nigh every turn.
The air was no longer that of the sunny steppe, nor that of
the shady grove; it was stifling as the atmosphere of a palm-house;
its temperature might vary from 70° to 80° Fahr.,
but it was so overloaded with an oppressive moisture exhaled
by the rank foliage that the traveller could not feel otherwise
than relieved to escape.</p>

<p>To the European lover of his garden everything at first
might seem to be as artistic in its grouping as it was abundant
in its luxuriance; but the screaming outcry of the birds
in the branches above, the annoying activity of the insect
world, and beyond all, the amazing swarms of minute ants
which come showering down from every twig upon anyone
who intrudes upon their haunts, detract very considerably
from the enjoyment of this prodigality of nature. Yet for
those who could persevere there was much to compensate in
the general solemnity of the scene, for the sound of the rustling
of the foliage above could scarcely penetrate the weird
shades below. Butterflies gay and busy in countless swarms,
with their gleaming yellow wings, gave animation to the
repose of the eternal green, and made up for any deficiency
of radiant bloom.</p>

<p>Our encampment was but comparatively a few steps away
from this unbounded storehouse of creative wealth, so that
with the greatest convenience I could prepare within my tent
for all my explorations. That dual character of the vegetation
to which I have referred offers a great advantage to the
botanist in this teeming district. In the damp atmosphere
of the western coasts the drying of plants is hardly ever
capable of being accomplished without exposing them for a
time before a fire, an operation which has generally the effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>
of inducing a blackness over the specimens which necessarily
very materially increases the difficulty of their being scientifically
examined when they reach their destination in
Europe; but here, except upon a thoroughly wet day, the
plants will all dry just as readily as they would in a country
where water is the reverse of abundant. When plants have
been gathered and dried in the hot steamy atmosphere
of Guinea, and corresponding plants have been gathered
and dried as they are found in Nubia, the comparison of
the two may assist in establishing what relations exist
between the bank wood and the steppes of the different
countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANDO.</div>

<p>I had already made the acquaintance of Wando’s sons, but
hardly expected the honour that Wando himself paid me by
visiting me in my tent. A troop of armed men composed his
retinue and arranged themselves in a circle round the tent,
whilst, with all deference, I made my illustrious guest the
offer of my own seat which I had brought with me from the
Gazelle. Wando was somewhat below a medium height, but
he could show a large development of muscle, and no insignificant
amount of fat. His features were of so marked and
well-defined a character, that in their way they might be
pronounced good, the head itself being almost perfectly
round. Nothing took me more by surprise at Wando’s entrance
than the perfect self-possession, which might almost
be called <i lang="fr">nonchalance</i>, with which he took the proffered seat.
Savage as he was, his composure and native dignity were
those of which no European when receiving homage would
need to be ashamed. Crossing his arms upon his breast, he
reclined one leg upon the other, and began to throw the centre
of gravity of his bulky frame so far behind the perpendicular
that I was in momentary fear lest the back of my chair
which creaked audibly at every movement of the Niam-niam
potentate, should be faithless to its trust. It seemed to sigh
beneath its burden. Wando reminded me in more than one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
respect of the portly king of Ovampo, on whom Galton
with some trouble forced the crown that had been brought
from the theatre. With the merest apology of a piece
of skin to cover him, he sat in all but absolute nakedness,
revealing the exuberance of fat which clothed his every
limb.</p>

<p>It was commonly said of Wando that he was the avowed
enemy of all cannibalism. I was informed in various quarters
that people from the neighbouring districts had come to
him when they found themselves growing too fat, and had
declared that they did not consider their lives were safe on
account of the men-eaters by whom they were surrounded.
But the sentiments of the chieftain did not appear to exercise
much influence upon the majority of his subjects, as we
only too soon became aware as we advanced farther to the
south.</p>

<p>This visit of Wando’s gave me an opportunity of which I
did not omit to avail myself of entering my indignant protest
against the want of hospitality with which on his part we
had been received. I recounted to him by way of contrast
the many acts of liberality which had been shown us by the
Nubians in general, assuring him that my dogs had received
more care from them than I, their master, had received from
him, king though he was; to supply my dogs with meat,
goats had been killed, and for myself bullocks had never
been spared. Wando remonstrated, saying that he had
neither one nor the other; but I made him understand that
he had plenty of poultry, certainly enough, and more than
enough, for me and my people. Finally, I proceeded to let
him know what I thought of his hostile demonstration before
our arrival; and while I spoke I dashed my fist upon the
camp-table which stood before us, till the plates and drinking
vessels clattered and jingled again. My personal attendants,
however, Mohammed Ameen and Petherick’s old servant, the
travelled and experienced Riharn, knew better, after all, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span>
I did, how to take Wando to task. Pointing to me, they
made him comprehend that he was threatened with a most
certain and speedy judgment if he suffered a Frank to come
to the most trifling harm. They charged him not to forget
that it was a Frank he was dealing with, and that it was
quite within the power of a Frank to make the earth to yawn
and from every rent to give out flames that should consume
his land. And as they spoke, the interpreters explained all,
word for word, to his excited understanding. Intimidated
to that degree of which none but a negro is capable, and
only eager to avert a miserable fate, he hurried back to
fulfil his promise of sending provisions without stint or
delay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TEMPTING DISH.</div>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards a number of his people
came teeming in, bringing not only some lean and half-fed
poultry, but a lot of great black earthen pots which
they laid down as offerings from their master at the
opening of my tent. A revolting smell of burning oil,
black soap, and putrid fish rose and stunk in the nostrils of
all who were curious enough to investigate, even from a distance,
the contents of the reeking jars; to those who were
so venturesome as actually to peer into the vessels, there
was revealed a dark-coloured stew of threads and fibres, like
loosened tow floating between leather shavings and old whip-thongs.
Truly it was the production of a savage, and I may
say of an indigenous, cookery, such as our progenitors in
their primeval forests might have prepared for themselves
out of roast rhinoceros or mammoth-foot. There seemed a
rebound in the lapse of time. As matter of fact, the caldrons
were full of a burnt smoky <i lang="fr">ragoût</i> made from the entrails of
an elephant some two hundred years old, very tough and
exceedingly rank. This wonderful example of nature’s
earliest promptings was handed first to me by the Bongo
bearers, whom I at once begged to accept for themselves the
dainty dish of the savages; but even the Nubians, not at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
too fastidious generally in anything which their religion
permits them to eat, rejected the mess with the greatest
disdain.</p>

<p>It had happened some years before, as one of Ghattas’s
companies was making their way across Wando’s territories,
that six Nubians were murdered in the woods by some natives
who had accompanied them to the chase, professing to be
their guides. As soon as the Nubians had fired away all
their ammunition in shooting at their game they had no
means of defence left in their power, and consequently were
easily mastered. Mohammed at once sent to demand the
six guns, which beyond a doubt were in the possession of
Wando’s people—&#8203;so anxious was he to prevent the natives
from becoming acquainted with the use of firearms. Wando
commenced by denying his ability to meet the demand, and
then resorted to procrastination; but subsequently, pressed
by Mohammed, who declared that the continuance of his
friendly relations must depend upon the restitution of the
guns, he surrendered four of them, asserting that the others
could not be found. Any further satisfaction was not to be
expected, because on the one hand there was either no getting
the perpetrators into custody, and on the other, even if
they could be brought from their place of refuge, no one
could be bribed to give any substantial evidence against
them.</p>

<p>On the second day after our arrival at Wando’s residence,
attended by a considerable number of natives and a dozen
soldiers, I made an excursion out for about two leagues
northwards along the banks of the Dyagbe. Guereza-monkeys
in merry groups were in the foliage above, but I was not
fortunate enough to bring down more than a single specimen.
According to the statements of my guides, who were hunters
by profession, chimpanzees were numerous, but we certainly
did not get a glimpse of one. Very weary with my exertions
of tramping over the marshy ground I was rejoiced to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
back into camp an ample booty in the way of botanical
rarities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LEAF-EATER.</div>

<p>During our travels I had obtained from the Niam-niam
who accompanied our caravan an epithet which I never lost
in all the subsequent stages of our journey. In their own
dialect these people called me “Mbarik-pa,” which would
be equivalent to a name amongst us of “Leaf-eater.” It was
a designation that reminded me very vividly of my professional
brother David Douglas, who fell a martyr to his devotion
to Nature, and who was known amongst the North-American
Indians as “the Grass-man.”</p>

<p>My Niam-niam interpreter Gyabir, as I learnt some time
afterwards, had given his friends some marvellous accounts
of the way in which I was accustomed to eat whatever I
found growing. He used to relate that I had a habit of
dismissing my attendants and getting into a dense thicket
where I imagined that I was unobserved, and that then I used
with great haste to gather and devour enormous quantities
of leaves, and he added that this was the way in which, one
day after another, I groped after my ordinary food. Others
contributed their observation that I invariably came forth
from the woods with an exhilarated expression and quite
a satiated look, whilst they were conscious of nothing
else than the cravings of hunger. After all it was very
natural; for the inspiration which is derived from contemplating
Nature can elevate one far above his mortal
and bodily wants.</p>

<p>The dominant idea which seemed to be impressed upon
the natives by my botanical ardour concentrated itself upon
their conviction as to the character of the country where the
white man has his home. According to their belief the land
wherein the white men spent their lives could show neither
grass nor tree, and consisted of nothing better than sandy
plain and stony flat. Those amongst them who had been
carried away as slaves in the ivory expeditions and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
returned again from Khartoom had brought strange accounts
of the grim desolation and utter drought of the Moslem lands
over which they had passed; and what, they asked, must be
the condition of the still remoter countries of the Frank, of
whom they only knew that he kept the Turk supplied with
cotton-stuffs and guns?</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">At</span> sunrise, on the 6th of March, we took our departure from
the abode of Wando. For our security on the way, the
caravan was attended by a number of guides which the chieftain
had placed at our disposal. Just before starting, the
intelligence arrived of the death of Nduppo, the alienated
and hostile brother of Wando. A party of armed men had
been despatched by Wando, and after a short conflict they
had killed the enemy. Nduppo’s wives and children had
taken refuge in Mohammed’s Seriba, where they met with a
hospitable reception and were provided with the residence
and provisions that were necessary for their support.</p>

<p>According to a custom which is generally recognised in
Central Africa, whenever a caravan mistakes its way and is
obliged to retrace its steps and return to a road from which
it has deviated, a bough is thrown across the wrong path and
a furrow is scratched in the ground by means of the feet, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span>
that no succeeding caravans may fall into the same error.
This duty is entrusted to the people accompanying the
standard-bearer in the rear.</p>

<p>The route of the first day led us along the right bank of
the Dyagbe, past Wando’s tall conical huts, and through
a gallery of picturesque wood scenery. Having forded the
stream which, plentifully supplied with water, resolved itself
into several channels, we rested on the farther side amidst
the outlying homesteads of the district. The startled inmates
made a momentary escape; but soon recovered from their
alarm, and returning to their dwellings commenced a brisk
business in selling poultry all along our line. The men
alone, however, brought their fowls, tied up in bundles, to the
market; the women kept themselves quite aloof. After a
brook of smaller dimensions had been crossed and some more
groups of huts had been left behind, the caravan arrived at
a stream of considerable magnitude known as the Billwey,
but which so much resembled the Dyagbe in the shady
character of its banks that it might very easily be mistaken
for it. Then ensued two of the “gallery” paths, the first
being quite small, the other somewhat larger and known by
the name of Mono. The district still seemed to be fairly
populous, and from all sides we were met by people who
came to us partly to offer their services as guides, and partly
to learn what particulars they could about the intentions of
the caravan. There was a coming and going which a European
might compare to the bustle of a general holiday at home.</p>

<p>Without stopping, however, we continued our progress, and
by noon we reached a brook called Diamvonoo, one of the
gallery streams, of which the banks were enclosed by dwellings.
Here we halted close to the huts of the superintendent
of the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOKENS OF CANNIBALISM.</div>

<p>The Niam-niam residences seem never to fail in having
some posts which the natives erect for the purpose of displaying,
in proof of their bravery, whatever trophies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span>
success they have gained either in hunting or in war. To
this practice, as established on the Diamvonoo, my osteological
collection is indebted for some considerable additions.
Attached to the projections of these memorial posts were
skulls of antelopes of many a species, skulls of little monkeys
and of great baboons, skulls of wild boars and of chimpanzees,
and I must not hesitate to add, skulls of men! These
were in some cases quite entire, whilst in others they were
mere fragments. They were fastened to the erections like
the presents on a Christmas-tree, but instead of being gifts
for children, they were treasures for the comparative
anatomist. Too decisive to be misunderstood were the
evidences of the propensity to cannibalism which met our
astonished gaze. Close to the huts, amongst the pile of
refuse, were human bones, which bore the unquestionable
tokens of having been subjected to the hatchet or the knife;
and all around upon the branches of the neighbouring trees
were hanging human feet and hands more than half shrivelled
into a skeleton condition, but being as yet only partially
dry, and imperfectly sheltered by the leaves, they polluted
the atmosphere with a revolting and intolerable stench. The
prospect was not inviting, and the asylum offered to travellers
was far from tempting; but we did not suffer ourselves to be
discouraged, and made up our minds to be as comfortable as
we could in our little huts.</p>

<p>Without loss of time I betook myself naturally to the
chase for trophies, Mohammed entering with so much zeal
into my pursuit after the skulls of some of the chimpanzees,
that he clambered up one of the votive pillars. This drew
upon us the eyes of the astonished natives, and their amazement
seemed to be especially directed to the circumstance of
our taking so much trouble into our own hands. “You have
plenty of slaves,” they said, “you are chieftains and have
authority; how is it that you are not ashamed to work for
yourselves in the way you do?” This, probably, was spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span>
in derision, or probably in a measure as a reproach to us for
appropriating what did not belong to us. However, I put
on the air of munificence, and set matters all right by a
prodigal distribution of copper rings.</p>

<p>Taking into account the large number of skulls of chimpanzees,
more or less perfect, which I saw in the hamlets on
the Diamvonoo, I am sure that I am quite justified in my
impression that this spot must be one of the centres from
which these creatures circulate their kind. Upon the
Western African coasts the prevalence of the chimpanzee
breed is very considerable, extending from the Gambia
down to Benguela. But in the interior, on the other hand,
the haunt of the chimpanzee hitherto has been supposed to
be limited to the country of the Niam-niam. Previous to
my arrival the Khartoom people had been the means of
securing some defective skins, which were sent to various
museums, and these were quite sufficient to confirm the fact
of the existence of chimpanzees in that quarter. But so
great was the variety in age and kind, so marked the difference
in these beasts according as they came from one district
or another, that a whole series, it appeared, of varying species
had to be distinguished and arranged by means of material
which was totally inadequate for scientific classification.
Nearly all the specimens at hand were those of very young
animals, and no mammal is known which as it grows older is
subject to more decided changes in its external appearance
than the anthropomorphic ape.</p>

<p>I am not speaking of Du Chaillu’s gorilla. This largest
of all apes is sufficiently known, and its specific stability
is no longer a matter of doubt. Its range, however, is
apparently very limited, as hitherto it has only been found
in the delta of the Ogowai.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TROGLODYTES NIGER.</div>

<p>On the other hand the chimpanzee, as it exists far and
wide in the west of Africa, has, in consequence of its individual
and collective features, been divided into a long series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>
of supposed species, varieties, and races, about which the
most skilled investigators in this branch of natural history
are by no means agreed. In one point they seem to be
unanimous, and all concur in recognising the <i lang="la">Troglodytes
niger</i>, E. Geoffr., as the progenitor or the normal type of this
series of anthropomorphic apes.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee of Central Africa, to judge from the
specimens that have found their way to European museums,
differs in many respects from the true <i lang="la">Troglodytes niger</i>, E.
Geoffr., and may be accounted as a separate race which in the
lapse of time has developed itself, and adapted its condition
to subsistence in far out-lying regions. Professor Giglioli, of
Florence has classified it as a subsidiary kind or sub-species,
to which he has assigned my own name, because, in 1866, I
was the first to bring any definite information about it.
In a work<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> elaborated with the utmost care he has collected
every detail that science offered to his hand. According
to Giglioli the chimpanzee of the Niam-niam countries was
distinguished from the <i lang="la">Troglodytes niger</i> of Western Africa
by the large capacity of its brain chamber, which he thought
could very probably not be matched by any other species.
We are indebted to Professor R. Hartmann, of Berlin, for a
monograph<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which has collected into one view, and may be
said to exhaust, all the material which has hitherto been
brought to bear upon this topic. From a comparison of a
very large number of specimens of very various origin, he
has come to the conclusion that the Niam-niam chimpanzee
has no such marked distinction as to isolate it in a systematic
sense, and that notwithstanding some subordinate characteristics
of race, it must still be reckoned as one amongst
the many forms of the <i lang="la">Troglodytes niger</i>.</p>

<p>In modern times there are no animals in creation which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
have attracted a larger amount of attention from the scientific
student of nature, than these great quadrumani, which
are stamped with such singular resemblance to the human
form as to have justified the epithet of anthropomorphic.
The most distinguished zoologists and anatomists have
devoted to them their best and undivided attention, and
their industry has resulted in the publication of splendid
works in illustration of their studies. The labours of Giglioli
and Hartmann indicate a still further advance in these
strivings after truth. These inquiries cannot fail to be as
supremely interesting to man, as the crown of creation, as the
prospect of the ultimate solution of the problems of ethnography
still hidden in the heart of the continent of Africa,
must be to the civilised nations of Europe. But all investigation
at present only leads human intelligence to a confession
of its insufficiency; and nowhere is caution more to
be advocated, nowhere is premature judgment more to be
deprecated, than in the attempt to bridge over the mysterious
chasm which separates man and beast.</p>

<p>Justly enough has Hartmann expressed his indignation
against those ephemeral writers and those <i lang="fr">dilettanti</i>, who,
incapable of scientific research and unfurnished with scientific
material, have ventured to handle the topic of the “anthropomorphic
apes.” These empty theorists, when they circulate
their baseless, or at least their unripe, hypotheses, may
perchance persuade themselves that they have mastered the
doctrine either of the elevation of the ape or the deterioration
of man; but in reality they have done nothing but aggravate
the bewilderment which already had turned the heads of a
half-wise generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHIMPANZEES.</div>

<p>It was getting well onwards towards night, and by the
red glare of the pitch-torch which is the invariable resource
for lighting the Niam-niam huts, I was getting my supper,
in the simplicity of the primitive times of creation, off
sweetened plantains and tapioca, when I was interrupted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
a visit from some of the natives who lived close at hand.
They had come to dispose of a collection of fine skulls of the
chimpanzee, and I effected the purchase by means of some
large copper rings. The people told me of the abundance
of these creatures in the adjacent woods, and related a
number of the adventures which had befallen them in their
arduous attempts to capture them: they promised, moreover,
to bring me some further contributions for my collection,
but unfortunately I could not wait to receive them; we
could not prolong our stay because of the scarcity of provisions,
and we had to start betimes on the following morning.
Altogether I made an addition of about a dozen skulls to
what I had previously secured, but many interesting fragments
I much regretted being obliged to leave behind, having
no alternative on account of my limited means of transport.</p>

<p>It was not my good fortune to witness a chimpanzee
hunt. This is always an arduous undertaking, involving
many difficulties. According to the statements of the Niam-niam
themselves the chase requires a party of twenty or
thirty resolute hunters, who have to ascend the trees, which
are some eighty feet high, and to clamber after the agile
and crafty brutes until they can drive them into the snares
prepared beforehand. Once entangled in a net, the beasts
are without much further difficulty killed by means of spears.
However, in some cases they will defend themselves savagely
and with all the fury of despair. Driven by the hunters
into a corner, they were said to wrest the lances from the
men’s hands and to make good use of them against the adversary.
Nothing was more to be dreaded than being bitten by
their tremendous fangs, or getting into the grasp of their
powerful arms. Just as in the woods of the west, all manner
of stories were rife as to how they had carried off young girls,
and how they defended their plunder, and how they constructed
wonderful nests upon the topmost boughs of the trees—&#8203;all
these tales, of course, being but the purest fabrications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span></p>

<p>Amongst the Niam-niam, the chimpanzee is called
“Ranya,” or “Manjarooma;” in the Arabic of the Soudan,
where long ago its existence seems to have been known, it
was included in the general name of “Ba-ahm.” The life
which the Ranya leads is very much like what is led by the
ourang-outang in Borneo, and is spent almost entirely in the
trees, the woods on the river-banks being the chief resort of
the animals. But in the populous Monbuttoo country, where
the woodlands have been thinned to permit the extensive
cultivation of plantains, the chimpanzees exhibit a great fear
of man, and pass their existence in comparative solitariness.
Like the gorillas, they are not found in herds, but either in
pairs or even quite alone, and it is only the young which
occasionally may be seen in groups.</p>

<p>For three leagues we advanced on the next day towards
the <abbr title="south south-west">S.S.W.</abbr>; and this was the general direction, with little
variation, by which we continued our progress to the Monbuttoo.
During this short interval we crossed no less than
five water-brooks, each of them bounded by its “galleries,”
and halted at last upon the right bank of a sixth which was
named the Assika. It was close to the quarters of a chief
whose name was Kollo. With the exception of a slight
elevation lying to the right, the whole surface of the land
between the streams was level steppe. The borders of these
streams were all well-populated; the soil was entirely under
cultivation, and appeared to be very productive. We found
ourselves here amidst a tribe, differing widely in habits and
dialect from the Niam-niam, and which bore the semblance
of being a transition population allied to the Monbuttoo who
occupied the districts in our front.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE A-BANGA.</div>

<p>This tribe is distinguished by the name of the A-Banga.
They are said to have come across the wide desert, which
bounds the territories of the two nations, and quite recently
to have migrated into the lands of the Niam-niam, submitting
themselves voluntarily to the sway of Wando. A very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span>
similar migration, resulting in the partial blending of the two
people, seems to have occurred in the west, where the A-Madi,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
driven out by over-population, their product of roots and
plantains, which they obtained without toil, being inadequate
for their support, resorted to the Gangarra hills of Indimma.
Some chance few of the A-Madi were found intermixed
with the A-Banga. Both of these could be thoroughly identified
with the Monbuttoo by their habits and mode of life,
but with regard to dialect, they would seem to have been
much influenced by their intermixture with the bordering
population of the Niam-niam. The last home which they
occupied as a clan was the populous province which the
Monbuttoo king Munza now possesses to the north of the
Welle. As the greater part of the A-Banga are quite capable
of speaking the Zandey (or Niam-niam) dialect, I had no
difficulty by the aid of my interpreters in holding conversation
with them; beyond the Welle, however, there were
very few with whom they were able to converse.</p>

<p>The first hamlets of the A-Banga which we entered, made
it at once clear that they adopted quite a different style
of building their huts to what we had already seen. The
conical form of the roofs, employed as it is in nearly every
other region of Central Africa, here began to give place
to the roof with a gable end which is universal farther south.
The square huts themselves were sometimes constructed with
posts and left open like sheds, and were sometimes enclosed
by four walls.</p>

<p>The dress and war equipment of the A-Banga are the same
as those of the Monbuttoo. The ears of both sexes are
pierced so that a good thick stick can easily be run through
the aperture, and for this purpose the concave portion of the
ear is cut out. As a consequence of this custom both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
A-Banga and the Monbuttoo have acquired from the Nubians
the name of the Gurrugurroo (derived from the word gurgur
which signifies “bored”) to distinguish them from the Niam-niam,
which is their term to denote all cannibals. The A-Banga
and Monbuttoo also practise circumcision, whilst the Niam-niam
abstain entirely from any mutilation of the body.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i524"></a>
<br>
 <img src="images/i_524.jpg"
 alt="An A-Banga">
 <p class="caption">An A-Banga.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Turned up into a high chignon, the hair is worn by the
women of the A-Banga without any head-covering, the men
commonly adopting the mode of the Niam-niam, who wear a
straw hat without a brim. Some of the men, however, as in
the accompanying portrait, make a compromise between the
Monbuttoo and Niam-niam fashion, wearing the hair in the
Monbuttoo style about the forehead and temples, and discarding
the chignon for the tufts worn by the Niam-niam.
The small apron which they wore was not, as with the Niam-niam,
made of skin, but from the bark of the Rokko fig-tree.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>
The shields did not consist of the oval wicker-work of rotang,
but were four-cornered tables of wood of a length sufficient to
protect the entire body. In place of the trumbash and Niam-niam
lance, they carried the lances, scimitars, and bows and
arrows of the Monbuttoo. The women go all but entirely
naked, wearing nothing but a fragment of the bark of the
fig-tree. Just under the arms, in the same way as the Monbuttoo
women, they bind a stout and broad strip of some
woven material, which when they sit upon their benches and
low stools hangs across their lap, and serves as well for a girth
in which to carry their little children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CULTIVATION OF MANIOC.</div>

<p>In this intermediate district between the corn-lands and
the lands in which roots or fruits were cultivated, the
fertility was very wonderful, and the agricultural labour that
was applied was very great. Besides eleusine and maize
there were many patches of penicillaria: amongst earth-products
I observed yams, helmia, colocasia, manioc, and the
sweet-potato; amongst various other leguminous plants there
grew the catyang or rawan-bean (<i lang="la">Vigna sinensis</i>), the horse-bean
(<i lang="la">Canavalia</i>), the voandzeia, and the <i lang="la">Phasæolus lunatus</i>;
the oily fruits included earth-nuts, sesame, and hyptis; whilst
there still remained room for Virginian tobacco, for the
sugar-cane, for the Rokko fig-tree, and for large numbers of
plantations of plantains (<i lang="la">Musa sapientium</i>).</p>

<p>Manioc plays an important part amongst the plants cultivated
in this region, both on account of the yield it gives and
the small amount of labour required in its cultivation. Here,
as in Guiana and Brazil, it seems to delight in a soil that
is rather moist and somewhat shaded, and accordingly the
position which is usually chosen for its culture is just on the
border of the “galleries” on the open steppe. The end of
April, at the real commencement of the rainy season, is the
best time for planting it. The plant is of a leafy growth,
it has hardly any wood, and attains a height varying from
three to six feet; the mode of planting it consists simply of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>
breaking off some pieces about a span long, and burying them
in the soil which has been superficially broken up. It is
quite unnecessary to trench it, since the soil is naturally very
light and loose, being composed principally of rotten leaves.
As the manioc is a year and a half or two years before it
produces strong tubers, it is customary to use the ground
between the rows, by planting, as is done elsewhere, various
other crops, either of maize, colocasia, or yams. One great
advantage connected with the manioc is the length of time
for which the tubers may be left in the earth after their full
development: provided only the ants can be kept from
them, they will remain in good condition for two or three
years; consequently they do not require to be housed, and
their culture admits of leaving the granaries free for other
provisions, in a way quite different from most tubers, which
would soon perish if suffered to remain in the wet soil.</p>

<p>The gathering is nearly as simple a process as the planting.
Each single plant is pulled away from the loose earth, and
the tubers are allowed to remain attached. In quality and
size they differ very materially. As the death of our poor
Bongo bearer had testified, some of the varieties when eaten
in a crude form are most poisonous, and even when boiled
they are very injurious unless the fibrous fringes have been
removed from the hearts. Scientific analysis has shown that
they contain a certain proportion of prussic acid, and there is
no doubt that their leaves when bruised emit the decided
odour of bitter almonds. The unwholesome kinds are generally
of small growth, and as a rule are of very woody
texture. The finer and nutritious sorts grow as large as a
man’s arm, and being very tender may be eaten with no more
misgiving than the camanioc of Brazil, which is the form of
the vegetable for which a great partiality is shown by the
Monbuttoo south of the Welle.</p>

<p>No one can have travelled much in the tropics without
being tolerably acquainted with the mode commonly practised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
of dressing the manioc. I will therefore only pause to
mention that the method followed here of getting rid of the
poisonous matter does not consist so much in expressing the
juices as in cutting up the tubers into pieces, and allowing
them to remain in water for more than four-and-twenty hours;
the result is that they get a very tainted flavour, which,
however, disappears again in the process of drying. A
long boiling finally prepares the manioc for eating. The
yield of starch, which is known as South American tapioca,
is estimated as one third of the weight of the fresh tubers.</p>

<p>Very probably, I should think, manioc has found its way
to this extreme limit of its culture from Angola, by means
of the intercourse of the people with the states under the
dominion of Miwata Yamvo, many of whose customs appear
to have been transferred to the Monbuttoo. But in all the
northern parts of the Nile region the cultivation of manioc is
still unknown, and although it has made its way into nearly
all countries on the coasts within the tropics, it has not
advanced towards Egypt as far as Nubia, or towards Arabia
as far as Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Thoroughly authenticated, meanwhile, stands the fact
that it was originally planted by the Portuguese upon the
western coasts, and first of all in Angola. An inference may
very fairly be deduced that in this way various other plants,
such as maize and tobacco, were introduced into Africa, and
only became naturalised at some date subsequent to the
discovery of America.</p>

<p>After scrutinising this district as fully as I could, I was
surprised never to find a single instance of the existence of
the <i lang="la">Carica papaya</i>, which has now for so long become indigenous
to all the maritime tropical countries of the world.
Barth speaks of its abundance in the states of Haussa, and
other travellers in the tropics have made frequent mention
of its growth, but I do not remember finding it in Egypt except
as a garden curiosity, while in Nubia and Abyssinia I never met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>
with it at all. I was the first to introduce tomatoes into the
district of the Gazelle, and I have no doubt that ere long
they will be extensively grown even in the most central
localities of Africa. Cultivated so easily as they are, they
nevertheless seem to be utterly wanting throughout all
the wild districts that have been hitherto explored in the
southern portion of the continent.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March some ivory business on the part of
Mohammed entailed the break of a day in our continued
march. The respite afforded me an opportunity, which I
readily embraced, of making a botanising trip to the rich
galleries of the woods on the Assika. Bribed by a few copper
rings, some natives willingly came with me and were of
infinite service in getting me the produce of some gigantic
trees which otherwise had been quite inaccessible. Amongst
these trees I may specially mention a Treculia, eighty feet
high, known as the “pushyoh,” one of the family of the
Artocarpeæ. The great globular fruit of this was larger than
my head, and seemed to realise the wish of the peasant in
the fable where he longed for a tree which would grow pumpkins.
I stood and gazed with astonishment at the A-Banga,
who seemed to have all the nimbleness of monkeys. By
taking hold of the boughs of the smaller trees, and bending
them down sideways, and tearing down the long rope-like
creepers, they contrived to climb the tallest and the smoothest
stems. Some of the trees were ten feet in diameter at the
base, and had a bark without a wrinkle; not unfrequently
they ran up to a height of some forty feet without throwing
out a single branch, standing, as it were, like the columns of
a thousand years in the piazzas of the Eternal City.</p>

<p>I had made some chain-shot, but neither by means of this
nor by the use of my heaviest single bullets could I succeed
in getting any specimens of the fruit which grew on the tops
of the tallest trees; my ordinary shot, however, sufficed to
bring down some detached leaves, from the examination of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span>
which I was able to form an opinion as to the true scientific
character of these giants of the wood. My proceedings appeared
to confirm the impression which the natives began to
form that I must be a leaf-eater.</p>

<p>Here on the Assika I found a kind of muscat-nut
(<i lang="la">Myristica</i>), and here too I gathered the first examples I had
seen of the West African cam-wood (<i lang="la">Pterolobium sandalinoides</i>),
which after it has been pulverised is commonly used
as a favourite rouge for the skin of the Niam-niam and
Monbuttoo men. The women, in both districts alike, are
accustomed to stain themselves by preference with a black
dye that is extracted from the pulp of the Gardenia fruit,
known as blippo. Here, likewise, I again saw another of
the notorious towering trees of Africa, the mulberry-tree
of Angola, which Welwitsch has asserted is known to grow
to a height of 130 feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>Reverting for a moment to what had transpired before, I
may mention that, on the preceding day, we had had our
first disagreement with the native population. Just before
we reached the Assika we were about to halt for a few
minutes’ rest, when, although our caravan was accompanied
by Kollo and Bakinda, the chiefs of the district through
which we were pushing, the owner of the land came and
began to inveigh against us with the most abusive language,
and, brandishing his spear in defiance, opposed our intention
to advance. He wanted to know what right the Turks had
to come spying out his place, and declared that he would
not submit to have them defile any of his quarters. An
outbreak seemed imminent; a mischievous combination was
only too likely, when, acting on Kollo’s advice, Mohammed
managed to quiet the uproar. He proceeded without further
parley to set light to one of the straw huts which was being
used as a granary; and it would be impossible to exaggerate
the fright and amazement of the natives when they saw him
take the flaming fire out of his hand. One single lucifer match<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</span>
had worked a miracle. There was no need of farther measures
of reprisal for our protection; when we reached the hamlets
on the Assika we found the natives quite amenable to our
wishes, and ready to permit us to instal ourselves amidst
their dwellings.</p>

<p>In the evening Mohammed established a shooting match.
The natives had never been made familiar with the effect of
our firearms, regarding them only as clumsy lances, or, as
they called them, great “iron sticks,” and Mohammed felt it
was desirable to inspire them with a proper respect for the
weapons. Selecting one of the thickest of the wooden gates
that, according to custom, swung in front of the huts, he set
it up for a target, and the general astonishment was unbounded
when it was discovered that out of fifty balls at a
hundred paces, at least ten had gone clean through the
wood. The Bongo bearers were then put through an exercise
of feigning an attack. With wild outcry, and still wilder
boundings and jumpings, they rushed upon their imaginary
foe, representing, in their way, the light cavalry dashing in
after the prelude of the roar of the artillery. Then, to
complete the illusion of the spectacle, they seized huge
clods of earth and great clumps of grass, and so returned,
a picture of troops laden with spoil, to the position from
which they had started. This was but a sham fight; but a
few weeks later, and the scene had to be re-enacted in
earnest.</p>

<p>The next movement of the caravan was towards the west.
Twice there were some brooks to cross, and after half a
league we halted by the Yuroo. We were now in a country
with a large population, the whole district being called
Nabanda Yuroo, or the “villages of the Yuroo,” as the
names of the streams in this region always give their designation
to the land. The stream was shadowed in the usual
way by the thickly developed growth of the gallery foliage,
and took a curve in the form of a horse-shoe. Within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span>
bend were scattered the farmsteads surrounded by large
groves of plantains of which the ripe fruit had been already
housed. The preparations that were set on foot towards
forming a camp without making use of the existing huts
either for the shelter of our baggage or for the reception of
the superiors, demonstrated at once that a residence here for
some days was certainly intended. The pretext alleged for
the stay was to allow the Mohammedans to solemnise the
anniversary of their new year. The issue, however, did not
answer to the expectation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENTERTAINING THE A-BANGA.</div>

<p>I had here to exhibit myself to a larger number of curious
eyes than usual; but I was able to obtain the measurements
of the skulls of some of the A-Banga, whilst others were
immortalised in my sketch-book. I had also to provide for
the entertainment of the people who came to visit me, and
in this respect was greatly assisted by my matches, as the
marvel of my being able to produce fire at my pleasure was
an inexhaustible source of interest. If ever I handed over a
lucifer and allowed them to light it themselves, their rapture
surpassed all bounds; they never failed to consider that the
power of producing flames resided in me, but their astonishment
was very greatly increased when they discovered that the
faculty could be extended to themselves. Giving the white
man credit for being able to procure fire or rain at his own
free-will, they looked upon the performances as miracles
unparalleled since the dawn of creation. For myself,
I sat composedly apart, as though invested with some
mysterious charm; but to say the truth, I was rather
bored by this conjuring, which was a stale excitement to
me, as it had now entered upon its second year of performance.
Still the wonder of the Africans seemed never
to cease, and they did not flag in their delight at the instantaneous
flame.</p>

<p>The method of obtaining fire, practised alike by the
natives of the Nile lands and of the adjacent country in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span>
Welle system, consists simply in rubbing together two hard
sticks at right angles to one another till a spark is emitted.
The hard twigs of the <i lang="la">Anona senegalensis</i> are usually selected
for the purpose. Underneath them is placed either a stone
or something upon which a little pile of embers has been
laid; the friction of the upper piece of wood wears a hole in
the lower, and soon a spark is caught by the ashes, and is
fanned into a flame with some dry grass, which is swung to
and fro to cause a draught, the whole proceeding being
to marvel which might well-nigh eclipse the magic of my
lucifer matches.</p>

<p>As we were now expecting a forced campaign of two days
through the wilderness, on the confines my servants had to
apply their attention to the provision of adequate supplies,
as whatever we required would have to be carried with us.
To accomplish our plan satisfactorily we were obliged to
contract a treaty offensive and defensive with the natives,
and nothing would suffice for this but a mutual interchange
of blood. The circumstance led me for the first time to
become a witness of this barbarous, but truly African custom.
The words of the pledge are emphatic: “In peace we will
hold together; in war we will be a mutual defence.” Osman,
one of my people who had come from Berber, being a novice
in the ranks of the Niam-niam campaigners, became one of
the most enthusiastic adherents to this pledge. In vain I
represented to him the unlawfulness of his conduct from a
Mohammedan point of view; I threatened that for the future
he should be called a heretic and an unbeliever, as bad as a
Kaffir; but all to no purpose: he became a blood-drinker by
profession, and so obtained from me whatever copper rings and
beads were necessary for cementing the bonds of the treaty.</p>

<p>The following day was devoted entirely to exploring the
sylvan flora around; to my heart’s desire could I now wander
amidst the thickets on the Yuroo, which would have been
deemed inaccessible to any one but a plant-hunter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOSTILE ATTITUDE OF THE NATIVES.</div>

<p>In the mould formed by the leaves which had decayed
beside the stream that parted itself into many a vein, I came
across a number of drums, stools, and other specimens of
wood-work which the natives had buried in the mud, in order
to give them a permanent blackness. This too is the way in
which they prepare the reeds of which they weave their
shields and matting. The process of rapid superficial humifaction
which takes place here, is to be attributed doubtless
to the temperature being so much higher than in the temperate
zones, where a corresponding degree of decomposition
would be the work of years.</p>

<p>Whilst botanising on the Assika we had more than once
been taken by surprise at arrows from some unknown hand
having fallen very near us. To bend down to pluck a remarkable
plant, and to take up some whistling arrow instead, is
not a common experience, even in Africa. The hostile and
defiant attitude of the natives was too plainly revealed to us,
when on the 11th of March the elder of my Niam-niam
attendants, Gyabir, was shot in the muscle of his arm.
Shrieking aloud in alarm and agony, he flung down my
valuable rifle, and betook himself to flight. So dense was the
thicket that I knew nothing of the disaster till my other
attendants came running up, and terror-stricken began to
shout, “They are coming! they are coming!” After this we
hurried back to the camp. I was very deeply concerned at
the supposed loss of my breech-loader, which I was accustomed
to call my “cook,” so serviceable had it been day after day,
in bringing down guinea-fowl and francolins for my table.
By good fortune, however, one of the Bongo folk had caught
sight of the weapon, and soon brought it back to me safe
and sound.</p>

<p>Several of the Bongo bearers had also returned wounded
more or less by these insidious arrows; none of them were
very severely injured, but they came back howling in alarm.
Each race seemed to have its own way of giving vent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span>
expressions of woe. The Niam-niam outcry for pain that
was sudden, was a sharp “Ow! ow!” but for a continued
pain it consisted of a prolonged “Akonn! akonn!” The
Bongo cry was “Aoh! aoh!”—&#8203;that of the Dyoor was
“Awai! awai!” For suffering of every degree the Monbuttoo
seem to have a word peculiar to themselves, and on
every occasion, however trivial, for a mere push or fall, they
will break out into a long-drawn wail of “Nangway!
nangway!”</p>

<p>The arrows of the A-Banga and the Monbuttoo differ from
those of other tribes by being provided at the extremity of
the shaft with two wings, which are made either of hairs from
the tail of the genet, or quite as often of bits of plantain-leaves.
In their points they correspond with those of the
Mittoo-Madi. The points are generally iron, but occasionally
they are made of wood which is almost as hard as iron. The
shafts consist of the firm reedy steppe-grass, and are of about
the thickness of a common lead-pencil. By a cruel refinement
of skill which might almost be styled diabolical, they contrive
to place one of the joints of the reed just below the barbs,
with the design that the arrow should break off short as
soon as it has inflicted the wound, making it a very difficult
matter to extract the barbs from the flesh. The
usual method of extracting a lance-head is to take a knife
and make a sufficiently large incision in the wounded muscle
for the barbs to be withdrawn; but, in fact, the result
generally is that very jagged and troublesome wounds are
inflicted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUR WOMEN CAPTURED.</div>

<p>No little excitement was stirred up in our encampment
when Gyabir came back wounded. I set to work and extracted
the arrow by breaking off the shaft, and drawing the
head out on the side of the arm opposite to that at which it
had entered. All the evening, however, I was too much
occupied in my own pursuits to have time to devote to the
consultations of the Nubians. As night was drawing on there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span>
was a fresh uproar, and the shrieks of women in alarm
revealed that some Job’s post of evil tidings had arrived.
Three female slaves had gone to the banks of the Yuroo to
fetch water for the camp, and had been discovered fatally
wounded, whilst six others had disappeared and had evidently
fallen into the hands of the A-Banga. A state of war then
was manifestly declared; at once a fresh supply of cartridges
was distributed to the soldiers, the sentinel-watches were
made doubly strong, and a detachment of Farookh was told
off and ordered to keep vigilant guard all night. Water for
the night was indispensable, and in order to fetch it a number
of women went down to the water-side, carrying torches in
their hands, and under the protection of a strong escort who
fired frequent shots into the bushes.</p>

<p>Mohammed proceeded on the following morning to distribute
his force into several companies, and as soon as it was
daylight sent them roaming over the environs, commissioned,
if possible, to obtain some hostages that might be exchanged
for the missing slaves. They found, however, that all the
farmsteads had been deserted by their inhabitants, and without
accomplishing their purpose they returned to the camp.
All the huts and the plantain-groves were spared, but only
provisionally. In the event of a thorough rupture the natives
in the immediate neighbourhood had more to fear than the
remoter people from the indiscriminate revenge of the Nubians,
and it was hoped that their influence would avail to secure
that the stolen women should be restored. In fact, several of
the local chiefs did come in the middle of the day for the
purpose of offering some explanation to Mohammed. Mohammed
made them clearly understand that unless by nightfall
the captives were delivered up every farm and every
crop in the district should stand in flames. The warning had
its due effect; the restitution was promptly made, and left us,
free and contented to prepare for our farther progress towards
the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span></p>

<p>Ready enough we were next morning to turn our backs
upon the inhospitable quarters, and to postpone a regular
warfare until the date of our return, when a conflict seemed
inevitable, and we should have but a hostile reception to
expect. The Bongo bearers had meanwhile taken good care
to replenish their stock of provisions by laying hands on every
granary they could, so as to be prepared for the transit over
the desert-country which lay between us and the friendly
territory of the Monbuttoo. We first passed over the Yuroo,
and shortly afterwards we crossed two other streams which
flowed into it, each full of water and with well-wooded banks.
After marching on for about two hours till we had passed the
last cultivated fields of the A-Banga, we arrived at a rivulet
which watered an open steppe, and finding some detached
and spreading fig-trees, we made a halt and took our morning
meal. A very obvious sinking of the land had ensued since
our passage over the previous streams, the surface of the soil
around being once more marked by undulations.</p>

<p>Onward for two leagues we went over a level steppe which
was all but void of trees, occasionally passing over some
sandy eminences which had all the appearance of being the
remnants of gneiss rocks decomposed by the lapse of time.
Comparatively a short period will suffice to obliterate these
remnants of rock as the formation of the superficial iron-stone
goes on. Altogether the region through which we were
passing now presented an aspect very different from the land
we were leaving behind, which had been very profusely intersected
by a very network of intricate watercourses all
bounded by abundant woods. Here the streams all irregular
and undefined, twisted their ambiguous way through marshy
meadows, their banks being totally destitute of woods;
some occasional clumps of Scitaminea being the only plants
to be seen. They had to be crossed as best we could at the
spots where the herds of buffaloes had trodden down the
slime into something of solidity; but the black water was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span>
frequently as high as our necks, whilst the mud beneath our
feet seemed to have no bottom. Numerous large frogs and
a number of land crabs (<i lang="la">Telphusa Aubryi</i>) were wallowing
in the half-dry pools on the banks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A STORM.</div>

<p>Especial precaution had to be taken here to protect the
baggage and to convey it across the swamps without injury.
We had successfully accomplished the passage of two of these
difficult fords, when the tokens of a gathering storm made us
halt for the night upon the banks of a third before we could
venture to proceed. As expeditiously as possible a tent was
erected, into which as much baggage was stowed as it could
contain, but it was far from being spacious enough to shelter
the whole, so that for the greater part of the night the
Nubians had to protect it by piling over it great ricks of
grass. An entire deficiency of wood made it impossible to
extemporize either huts or sheds. The tumultuous confusion,
the shouting and the running, the rescuing here, the escaping
there, and all amidst the crashing thunder of the tropics, and
in a torrent of rain that fell as though the very sluices of
the sky were open, conspired to form a study from which a painter
might conceive a picture of the Deluge. The meadow-stream
by which we were compelled to pass this luckless night had
a direction that was easterly, and therefore contrary to that
of the rivers we had previously passed; it flowed to join the
Kahpily which may be described as a river of the second
magnitude, and which unites its dashing flood with the more
northerly of the two sources of the Welle, the Keebaly and
the Gadda.</p>

<p>Frightfully hungry after the disturbed vigil of the night,
but yet still fasting, we proceeded at dawn to take the mudbath
which crossing the stream involved. Some Bongo who
were adepts at swimming had to go in front and convey great
masses of grass and Phrynia, which they let down in the
deepest parts to cover the sinking bottom. Going on
in the same southerly direction as on the day before, we passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>
along the sunken ground, and after a while came to a brook
which once again was shaded by luxuriant gallery-woods.
The path that led through the thickets down to the main
arm of the stream had been for so many feet encroached
upon by the water, which rose high in consequence of its
contracted channel, that the only means of progress was either
along the unstable trunks of fallen trees, or through puddles
in which it was hard to preserve one’s equilibrium. The
narrow rift was cut out from the entanglement of foliage,
creepers, roots, and branches, as neatly and smoothly as
though it had been trimmed by a knife.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i538"></a>
<br>
 <img src="images/i_538.jpg"
 alt="Platycerium">
 <p class="caption"><i lang="la">Platycerium Elephantotis</i>, Schweinf.<br>One-eighth of natural size.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Never before had I seen such wonderful masses of lichens,
of which the long grey garlands hung down in striking contrast
to the deep green of the foliage above. Just like the
“barba espanola” of the forests of the Mississippi, a gigantic
form of our <i lang="la">Usnea florida</i> here adorned every tree. But a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span>
decoration stranger than all was afforded by the Platycerium,
which projected in couples, like elephant’s ears, from the
branches of the trees; it is one of the most characteristics of
all the gallery-flora of the region. Another species of the
genus which I had observed in other parts, the <i lang="la">Platycerium
stemmaria</i>, with its bifurcate leaves, here too finds a conspicuous
place.</p>

<p>In these ancient woods, however, there is nothing that could
more attract the attention of the naturalist than the wonders
of the world of white ants. So assiduous are they in their industry
and so inexplicable in their work, that their proceedings
might well-nigh tempt a scientific student to take up his
permanent abode near their haunts. They construct their
nests in a shape not dissimilar to wine-casks, out of thousands
and thousands of leaves, which they cement together with a
slimy clay, using a strong bough for the axis of the whole, so
that the entire fabric is suspended at a giddy height.</p>

<p>This species of white ant (<i lang="la">Termes arborum</i>) had been already
observed by Smeathman in Western Africa. The partition
their buildings using wood-shavings and bits of bark,
and in the same way as the forest-ants they make several
stories, and set apart nurseries and chambers for the young.</p>

<p>Just as the bottle-gourd of the primeval wilderness offered
to a primitive people the first models for their earthenware,
so have the structures which the ants contrive from leaves
furnished the natives of Central Africa with the general
design of all their basket-work. Already I have referred to
the corn-baskets of the Bongo as one of the earliest illustrations
of the fact that their weaving is but a faithful copy
of the building of the ants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REACHING THE MONBUTTOO FRONTIER.</div>

<p>Coming next to a tract of brushwood, and then crossing two
more galleries, on which was displayed all the wild beauty of
the virgin forest, we arrived about midday at the stream
which marks the boundary of the kingdom to which we were
directing our way. The passage across this river occupied us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span>
more than half-an-hour, so intricate was the labyrinth of the
uprooted trees over which it was necessary to clamber; and
the way was made still more difficult by the thorny interlacings
of the Smilax and the obstructive jungles of the
Rotang.</p>

<p>Whether open by chance or cleared by human hands, it
was hard to determine, but there were spaces in the gallery-woods
which were comparatively void of trees; over these
was spread an abundant growth of plantains, which had a
look most perfectly in harmony with the primitive wilderness
around. Only on the fallen trees was it possible to
effect a passage amidst the confusion of the many channels;
for the network of the drooping creepers baffled every attempt
to swim. At length, however, all was accomplished, and
we were greeted by a view of the hospitable home of the
Monbuttoo.</p>

<p>After taking some brief repose on the frontier of the new
country, followed by troops of men and women, we proceeded
to the residence of Nembey, a local chieftain under King
Degberra, who governs the eastern half of the Monbuttoo,
whilst the western portion belongs to Munza, a sovereign
who rules with a still more powerful sway. The abode of
Nembey was situated on a rivulet called the Kussumbo,
which rolls on its crystal waters in a deeply-hollowed channel
to join the Kahpily. Crossing the stream, we encamped upon
some slightly undulated ground, encompassed by low bushes,
where we erected some grass-huts that should be perfectly
rain-proof. Immediately upon our arrival, Nembey accompanied
by a number of his wives, paid me a visit in my tent,
and brought me a present of poultry.</p>

<p>Mohammed Aboo Sammat was an old friend and ally of
the western king Munza, who was never otherwise than
upon a footing of war with his neighbor and rival Degberra.
Little therefore could Mohammed have expected in the way
of welcome or hospitable reception from the king of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span>
Eastern Monbuttoo, if it had not chanced that his subordinate
officer had discovered the advantageous ivory trade which
might be opened with the strangers. This is the explanation
which may be offered of the courtesy of our reception, and
which accounts for the neighborhood all round being free
from any peril as far as we were concerned.</p>

<p>The woods on the Kussumbo I found to be an inexhaustible
source of botanical treasure. Conspicuous amongst many
other examples of the characteristic vegetation were the
Raphia, the Elias, the bread-fruit or Artocarpus, and a species
of Trumpet-tree (<i lang="la">Cecropia</i>) which was the first representative
of the American genus that I had found in the continent
of Africa. The oil-palm (<i lang="la">Elias</i>) is here at the extreme
northern limit to which cultivation has ever transferred it,
as it is still utterly unknown in all the districts of the Nile.
Not until we crossed the Welle did we find it planted out
in groves, and to judge from appearances it had only been
planted even there for purposes of the experiment.</p>

<p>Upon the day following our arrival at the residence of
Nembey, I ventured out without any apprehension of harm
into the semi-cultivated plantain-grounds which ran for
some miles along the river-banks, passing as I went along
series of farms and fields that were under tillage, everywhere
observing the women and children sitting in front of
their neatly-kept huts and attending to their household duties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ALARM.</div>

<p>The sun was just sinking on the horizon, and we were still
enveloped in the thickets shrouded in masses of manioc and
plantains, when the report of firearms, volley after volley,
coming from the camp, took us by surprise, and induced us
without delay to hurry back; such repeated discharges, we
could not help suspecting, must too surely betoken some
aggression on the part of the natives. We loaded our pieces,
and trying to follow the direction of the sound, we started off
on our return, but for a time we wandered vaguely about,
hardly knowing how to get free of the plantations; we at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>
length managed to reach the villages, from which the way
was quite direct. Together with ourselves streamed on a
crowd of the residents, who came hurrying out, equipped
with their shields and lances, or with their bows and arrows.
As we approached the farms we heard the beating of the
signal drums, and everywhere at the doors of the huts we
saw the women and children, all eagerly bringing from the
interior the necessary arms for their husbands and fathers,
who were waiting impatiently without. Not knowing whether
we were friends or foes, we pushed on all together along the
road. Helpless enough I felt myself, as burdened with my
heavy boots I tottered over the smooth tree-trunks which had
been thrown across the depth of the Kussumbo; behind and
before were the excited people, equipped with arms, as frantic
as wild Indians, and very naturally the thought rose to my
mind, how completely, if they chose, I was within their
power.</p>

<p>It did not take long to get through the woodlands, and
then again we were out upon the open. One glance at
the camps before us revealed the mystery: the Nubians
with their swarthy troops of bearers had been doubled in
number by the arrival of another company of merchant-people
from Khartoum, and in honor of the meeting the
usual salvoes had been fired. The new comers were
the party belonging to Tuhamy, who was an upper secretary
in the divan of the Governor-General, by whose authority I
was empowered to claim the hospitality of all the Seribas.
To Mohammed’s soldiers the unlooked-for arrival of a number
of their countrymen was a welcome occurrence which they
celebrated as a holiday but to Mohammed himself
the chance meeting was a vexation, from which ultimately, as he
foresaw, various unpleasantnesses arose. The territories of
Tuhamy’s people were situated on the lower Rohl, their head
Seriba is at a spot named Ronga, where they had been
established some years previously by the French adventurer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>
Malzac. They had come directly by the way through the
districts of the Mittoo and the Madi; and at the Diamvonoo,
(where I had made so large a collection of the skulls of the
chimpanzees) they had had such a vigorous conflict with
the Niam-niam that for two days they were obliged to
defend themselves behind an extemporized abattis against
the hostilities of Wando, and had not escaped without
some loss of life on their side. Suspecting no mischief,
they had arrived at the place just at the moment that
our caravan had hurried away to escape the general conflict
that seemed imminent, and accordingly, they had
found the natives all up in arms and ready for immediate
action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO BONGWA.</div>

<p>At midnight a heavy rain set in, which lasted till the
morning; and in the uncertainty as to what the weather
would be, our departure was delayed long beyond the
ordinary hour and we were even at last obliged to start in
a thick and drizzling mist. Despite the wet, Tuhamy’s
party had gone on in the early morning. We were all
anxious about keeping our powder dry; but, for my part,
I must own I was more concerned about the safety of my collection,
which had been gathered and preserved with so
much trouble. A halt was made for an hour in one of the
farmsteads on our way and the large open sheds belonging
to the local superintendent were of infinite service in providing
immediate shelter for the baggage. Our route crossed
four streams, all flowing to the south, after which we arrived
at the Mazoroody, on the banks of which the line of farms
belonging to Bongwa extended a considerable way. Bongwa
was a chieftain subject to pay tribute equally to Munza and
to Degberra, as his possessions were contiguous to those of
both these rival kings. We crossed the river, which was
approached by an extensive steppe, which terminated in a
declivity that led us downwards for well-nigh 200 feet, and
then halting, we proceeded to erect our camp by constructing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>
a number of huts in the best way we could out of the masses
of sodden grass.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i544"></a>
<br>
 <img src="images/i_544.jpg"
 alt="Title or description">
 <p class="caption">Bongwa’s Wife.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Accompanied by his wife, Bongwa paid us a visit to camp,
and allowed me the unusual honor of taking a sketch both
of himself and his better half. The old lady took her
seat upon a Monbuttoo bench, wearing nothing else than the
singular band, like a saddle-girth, across her lap, in the
general fashion of all the women of the country. Like nearly
all her race, she had a skin several shades lighter than
her husband’s, being something of the color of half-roasted
coffee. She exhibited singular tattooing, which appeared
to consist of two distinct characters. One of these ran in
lines over the shoulders and bosom, just where our ladies
wear their lace collars; it was made of a number
of points pricked in with a needle, and forming a pattern
terminating on the shoulders and breast in large crosses.
The other was a pattern traced over the whole stomach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
standing out in such relief that I presume it must have been
done by a hot iron; it consisted of figures set in a square
frames, and looked somewhat like the tracery which is sculptured
on cornices and old arches. Bodkins of ivory projected
from her towering chignon, which was surmounted by
a plate as large as a dollar, fastened on by a comb with five
teeth manufactured of porcupine-quills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONGWA’S WIFE.</div>

<p>Since Madame Bongwa only intended to pay me a short
visit, she did not appear <i lang="fr">en grande tenue</i>; the picture, therefore,
necessarily failed in the black figures which, for full
dress were painted on her ample flanks, and which would
have given a double interest to the likeness. As a token of
my recognition of the steadiness with which she sat during
my artistic labors, I permitted her (and this was the greatest
the privilege I could afford any of the natives) to put her fingers
through my hair, which to her eye was so astonishingly long
and sleek.</p>

<p>The first hours of the following morning were spent in
making purchases from the natives of a supply of yams and
sweet-potatoes; the day, consequently, was somewhat advanced
before we could make a start. The strips of grassland,
void of trees, into which the numerous rivulets parcel
out the district, were here peculiarly narrow; in the course
of a single league, we passed over no less than three different
streams, and then came to another, the Bumba, which we
had to go over twice. Whenever we came to thickets, the
Raphia or wine-palm was sure to be prominent, and put
every other plant into the shade. Its noble branches are
used by the Monbuttoo for making their stools and the seats
which they erect upon the roofs of their huts.</p>

<p>A very populous district was soon reached, known as the
district of Eddeedy, who being within Munza’s kingdom was
tributary to Izingerria, Munza’s viceroy and brother. At this
spot, we came again into contact with the party of Tuhamy,
which had encamped upon the river Bumba. We had for so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>
long been unaccustomed to the sight that the prospect of
grazing cattle came upon us almost as a surprise. At first
we were under the impression that Tuhamy’s people must
have brought the oxen with them, but the manifest deviation
of the beasts from the Dinka type set us to inquire
whence they had come. They were of a thicker and
shorter build than those we had seen, having a different
formation of the skull and very prominent humps. We were
informed that they had been a present from King Munza
to Eddeedy. Munza himself had some years previously received
a large herd of them from the powerful ruler of some
people in the south-east, with whom he had concluded an
amicable alliance. The tribe who were thus referred to
were called by my interpreter the Maogoo, and I imagined
that through this word I could get some perception of what
Sir Samuel Baker meant when he spoke of the land beyond
Lake Mwootan as Ulegga, and its inhabitants as the Malegga.</p>

<p>Taking now a more southerly direction, the road led us
over three different streams, which flowed to the west to join
the Bumba. On the fourth stream from the Bumba was
situated the mbanga of Izingerria. It was somewhat late in
the afternoon before we made our imposing entrance, and
then we found both sides of the roadway lined with crowds
of astonished folks who had come to gaze at our troop. The
officials appeared in full state, their hats adorned with waving
plumes: they had come attended by their shield-bearers, and
had ordered their indispensable benches to be brought with
them, that they might receive us at their ease and observe
the unusual spectacle we presented with as much convenience
as possible.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>We took up our encampment on the steppe just beyond
the stream which divided us from the circle of huts, which
was arranged around an open area, and allotted to the wives
and soldiers of the prince. The plots that had been cleared
near the little river were for the most part planted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span>
sugar-canes. The canes grew to the size of a man’s arm, but
I think they were generally very woody and less soft in
their texture than those which grew in Egypt. Except for
chewing, the natives seem to have no object in growing them,
and have no notion of expressing or boiling the
sap, for otherwise, they would not have been so surprised as
they were at the bits of loaf-sugar which we gave them by
way of putting their experience to the test. The plants
thrive very well in the plantations, which are amply irrigated
by the numerous ducts of the various streams, and,
indeed, they grow in a half-wild condition. Had the natives
only a better disposition for industry and a freer scope for
traffic, there is no estimating what might be the value of the
production which is here so bountifully bestowed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT TO IZINGERRIA.</div>

<p>In company with Mohammed I visited Izingerria in his
dwelling in the later hours of the evening, and found him
sitting on his bench in the open space, surrounded by about
a dozen of his satraps. Having been made acquainted with
the custom of the country that all officials, all heads of
families, and indeed all persons of any distinction, whenever
they pay a visit, take with them their slaves to carry their
benches, because it is considered unseemly to sit, like Turks
or Arabs, upon the ground, I gave orders that some of my
people should, on these occasions, invariably accompany me
and carry my cane chair. We took our seats opposite Izingerria,
and by the assistance of one of the natives, who could
talk to my Niam-niam interpreter, I contrived to keep up,
despite the labor of a double translation, some mutual
interchange of thought till the night was far advanced. Of
hospitable entertainment there was not a word; perhaps it
was considered inconsistent with the dignity of a formal interview,
but there was not even the offer of the usually elusive
beer. The consumption of tobacco, however, was quite unrestrained.
I could not help observing, without being quite
able to account for the circumstance, that my cigars did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
in the least appear to attract any notice on the part of the
natives, although they were accustomed to smoke their
tobacco exclusively through pipes, and were as entirely unacquainted
either with the habits of chewing tobacco or of
taking snuff as any other of the African negroes who have
not been contaminated in these respects by intercourse with
Mohammedans and Christians.</p>

<p>The Monbuttoo use pipes of a primitive, but really of a
very serviceable description, which they make from the
mid-rib of a plantain-leaf. The upper classes, however, not
unfrequently have a metal tube, some five feet long, made
by their smiths. The lower extremity of the pipe is plugged
up, and an opening is made in the side near the end, into
which is inserted a plantain-leaf, twisted up and filled with
tobacco. This extemporised bowl is changed as often as
requisite, sometimes every few minutes, by the slaves who
are kept in attendance. The only tobacco which is known
here is the Virginian (<i lang="la">N. tabacum</i>, L.). With much relish
I smoked a pipe of this construction, which was altogether
a novelty to me, and I found that it was a contrivance that
modified the rankness of the tobacco almost as perfectly
as if it had been inhaled through the water-reservoir of a
narghileh.</p>

<p>At length the attainment of my cherished hopes seemed
close at hand. The prospect was held out that on the 19th
of March we might expect to arrive at the Welle. The way
to the river led us due south, and we went onwards through
almost uninterrupted groves of plantains, from which the
huts, constructed of bark and rotang very skilfully sewn
together, ever and again peeped out. A march of scarcely
two leagues brought us to the bank of the noble river, which
rolled its deep dark flood majestically to the west, in its
general aspect suggesting a resemblance to the Blue Nile.
For me it was a thrilling moment that can never fade from
my memory. My sensations must have been like Mungo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span>
Park’s on the 20th of July, 1796, when for the first time he
planted his foot upon the shore of the mysterious Niger,
and answered once for all the great geographical question of
his day—&#8203;as to whether its waters rolled to the east or to
the west.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WELLE.</div>

<p>Here, then, I was upon the very bank of the river, attesting
the western flow of the water, about which the contradictions
and inconsistencies of the Nubians had kept up my unflagging
interest ever since we set out from Khartoum. Whoever has
any acquaintance with the indistinctness that ever attaches to
the statements of those who would attempt to describe in Arabic
the up-current of the down-current of a river will readily
comprehend the eagerness with which I yearned to catch the
first glance of the waters of which the rippling sound, as they
washed their stony banks, came through the bushes to my
a strained and listening ear. If the river should flow to the east,
why then it solved the problem, hitherto inexplicable, of the
fulness of the water in Lake Mwootan; but if, as was far more
likely, it should go towards the west, then beyond a doubt it
was independent altogether of the Nile system. A moment
more and the question was set at rest. Westerly was the
direction of the stream, which consequently did not belong
to the Nile at all; it was in all likelihood not less than 180
miles distant from the most western coast of Lake Mwootan,
and at the numerous rapids which are formed in its upper
course it rises almost to the level of the lake, even if it does
not attain a still higher altitude.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Very similar as I have said it looked in some respects to
the Blue Nile at Khartoum, the Welle had here a breadth of
800 feet, and at this period of the year, when its waters were
at their lowest, it had a depth varying from twelve to fifteen
feet. The banks, like the “guefs” of the Nile, rose about
twenty feet above the level of the stream and appeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>
consist almost exclusively of alluvial clay and some layers
of blended sand and mica; but as far as I could investigate
the exposed face of the river-wall, I could see neither pebbles
nor drift, and only occasionally were the scanty remains of
shells to be detected.</p>

<p>Here, as well as on the upper part of the main stream,
named the Keebaly, which we subsequently crossed, no
inundation of the country seems ever to occur, although the
land sank with rather a sudden fall for 100 feet down to the
wood-encircled bank of the river.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about the rate at which the
water flowed: on the northern bank it passed at about fifty-five
or sixty feet a minute; so that the volume of water that
rolled by would be about 10,000 cubic feet a second, but supposing
the rate of the stream to be invariable, this volume
would be nearly doubled at the season when the river was at
its fullest height. The Welle is formed about twelve miles
above this spot by the union of the Gadda and the Keebaly.
About three weeks later (on the 13th of April) the Gadda
was about 155 feet wide and two to three feet deep, whilst the
Keebaly, which is the main stream, was 325 wide and at least
twelve feet deep. Of the two streams just above the junction,
the rate of flow was fifty-seven feet and seventy-five
feet respectively. Fourteen miles above its point of confluence
with the Gadda, the Keebaly forms a series of rapids
flowing over innumerable crags of gneiss, making a labyrinth
of little islands which are known as Kissangah, and which
part the stream into many minor channels that after they are
re-united reach across in a distance of 1000 to 1200 feet from
shore to shore.</p>

<p>I made all the inquiries I possibly could about the condition
and fluctuations of the river from the interpreters who
were attached to the expedition, and ascertained that the
water was actually at this date at its lowest level. The first
an indication that I had of any rise or increase in the stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span>
was when I crossed it again a little higher up, towards the
east, in the middle of April; and to judge from what was
pointed out to me then on the river-banks, I should conjecture
that the period of the highest water would be about two
months later.</p>

<p>The Welle had all the tokens of being a mountain stream
of which the source was at no remote distance, and to a certainty
was not in a latitude much to the south of that of the
spot where we were crossing. The colour of the flood at this
time of the year corresponded very remarkably with the
cloudy waters of the Bahr-el-Azrek, and it is probable that
when it is at its height it has that look of coffee-and-milk
which the river presents at Khartoom. Moreover, there is
an additional proof indicating that the river has its origin
in some mountain region at no great distance, which is furnished
by the fact of so many considerable streams (such as
the Keebaly, the Gadda, the Kahpilly, the Nomayo, and the
Nalobey) all having their channels uniting in what is comparatively
a very limited area. The result of all my varied
inquiries seemed to demonstrate most satisfactorily that to
the south-west of Munza’s residence the land takes a decided
rise; and the existence of certain detached groups of hills,
which according to the declarations of the natives are at no
very great distance, serves to confirm my belief as to the
orographical character of the country. The hills and isolated
mountains to which I refer would be, I imagine, none other
than the western fringe of the “Blue Mountains,” which
Baker observed from the farther side of Lake Mwootan (the
Albert Nyanza), and of which (as he saw them on the north-western
confines of the lake), he reckoned that the height
must be 8000 feet.</p>

<p>From this spot also the position of the abodes of the tribe
of the Maogoo was pointed out to me, and it lay between the
<abbr title="south-east">S.E.</abbr> and <abbr title="east south-east">E.S.E.</abbr> It was to me a very remarkable thing how
accurately the natives of Africa, by the indication of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span>
finger, would point to any particular locality; they were also
equally skilful in telling the hour of the day by the height
of the sun, and I rarely detected an error of much more than
half an hour in their representations. In wide open plains
like the deserts of Nubia, where the journeys are made for
many miles consecutively without the least variation in direction,
the precision of their estimate reaches such singular
correctness, that if a lance is laid upon the ground the path
to which it points will lead, with scarcely a hair’s-breadth
deviation, to the destination required, and the road thus
indicated will accord perfectly with any direct route that
may be marked upon the map. Many years ago Bruce of
Kinnaird alluded to a circumstance of this kind in his travels
through the Nubian desert; and during my wanderings between
the Nile and the Red Sea I had various opportunities
of satisfying myself of the truth of what he states.</p>

<p>Taking into calculation the geographical configuration of
this part of Africa, and relying not so much upon the representations
of previous European travellers as upon the information
obtained along the wide tract that extends from Lake Tsad
to Kordofan and south of that line, it may be asserted that
the Welle belongs to the system of the Shary. That the
Welle has any connection with the Gazelle, and so ultimately
with the Nile, is contradicted not merely by the general
belief, but by the authenticated statements of the inhabitants
who dwell upon its borders; and more than this, it is totally
inconsistent with the fact that the Welle is a stream vastly
greater than the Gazelle in the volume of its waters; for
while both alike were at their lowest ebb on the 27th of
April, 1863, Petherick has placed it upon record that the
Gazelle had but 3042 cubic feet of water to roll on, in comparison
to 10,000 feet, which was the volume, every second,
of the Welle.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may seem to lay greater stress upon the information
which I gained by my inquiries, than a rigorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span>
critic, who knows what an ambiguous country I was traversing,
may be inclined to think is fair. But let me invite his
attention to the following statement. Although the entire
eastern portion of the Niam-niam country from Mofio to
Kanna has been repeatedly visited by companies from Khartoom,
and I have been repeatedly brought into contact with
those who have taken part in the expeditions, I have never
come across but one single individual who has represented
that there is connection anywhere between the Welle and the
Gazelle; and in addition to this, the Monbuttoo and the
Niam-niam, with an agreement that is undeviating, all represent
that the Welle holds on its course to the <abbr title="northeast">N.E.</abbr> as far as
they could follow it for days and days together, till it widens
so vastly that the trees on its banks are not visible, and
that at last there is nothing but water and sky. This representation
would imply that the river issues in some inland
lake. They have, moreover, their tales to tell of the inhabitants
of the country on the lower part of the river, as to
how they dress in white, and like the Nubians kneel upon the
ground and say their prayers. Clearly, therefore, these residents
are Mohammedans, and the direction and the distance
of their abode would seem to corroborate an impression
that they must be the inhabitants of some southern parts of
Baghirmy.</p>

<p>As I have spoken of the Welle in comparison with the
Gazelle, I may now be permitted to bring it into contrast
with the Shary, so far at least as the lower course of this
river has been explored. According to the testimony of
Major Denham, who made his observations on the 24th of
June, 1824, the width of the Shary at its mouth was about
half a mile, while its stream had a velocity of something
under three miles an hour. This would indicate a stream
three times as strong as that of the Welle, and if the average
depth of the waters as they flow into Lake Tsad be reckoned
at ten feet it would give a volume of 85,000 cubic feet a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
second, whereas at the very highest reckoning the volume of
the Welle is not above 20,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p>On the other hand the eastern main branch of the Shary at
Mele, where it was measured by Barth on the 18th of March,
1852, had a breadth of 1800 feet, and in mid-channel it had a
depth of fifteen feet, while it was specially recorded as rolling
on with a velocity of some three miles an hour, which, however,
in a way that we should not have expected, Barth says did
not make him reckon the stream as particularly strong.</p>

<p>That the Shary, so early as the month of March, should show
an increase in the mass of its waters, would appear to indicate
that according to theory it must be augmented by some other
rivers coming from more southern latitudes than the Welle. It
is a positive fact that there are no other streams of the least
account that could possibly flow into it from the arid steppes
of Darfoor and Wadai on the north; the land there has no
springs, and consumes for itself whatever it receives from the
clouds above. If then the Welle flows neither into the Gazelle
nor yet into the Shary, it might perhaps be asked whether
it is not a tributary to the ample waters of the Benue, which
Barth found at Yola, on the 18th of July, 1851, to be 1200
feet in width, having an average depth of 11 feet, and a
periodic change of 50 feet between the highest and lowest
level of its stream; but then there would still remain the
further question as to what, in that case, must be the source
of the Shary, and whence it comes; and this is a question
that decides for itself the full value of the counter-evidence.</p>

<p>It is a matter of especial interest to recollect that Barth
would appear already to have announced the existence of the
Welle under the name of the river of Kubanda. The people
that he had about him were natives of Darfoor, who had been
accustomed to carry on their expeditions for plunder ever
since the year 1834. In fact he assigns the position of the
river of Kubanda to the latitude of 3° N., and affixes a note
to his account of it stating that “a tree, called the Kumba, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>
said to grow upon its banks.” Now, Kumba is the Niam-niam
for the abundant Malaghetta pepper (<i lang="la">Xylopia æthiopica</i>),
which has communicated its name to the Pepper Coast, and
in the middle ages was a spice much valued and known
as Habb-el-Selim (Selim’s grains), and had probably been
brought into the market by the people of Morocco, long
before black pepper was known at all. I satisfied myself
that at present this pepper is known to the Foorians as a
product of the distant south.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONBUTTOO CANOES.</div>

<p>The transport of the caravan across the great river was by
no means an easy matter; by the aid, however, of the ferrymen
whom Munza had provided, it was accomplished so
vigorously that in the course of three hours our last man had
been carried over. The passage was effected by large canoes
which were hewn out of a single trunk of a tree, and which,
alike in shape and solidity, were superior to what we had
hitherto seen. Some of them were not less than thirty feet
long and four feet broad, and sufficiently spacious to convey
both horses and bullocks. So ample are their dimensions
that there is no risk of their being upset, nor did they lurch
in the least degree as we got into them. They were made
with both ends running horizontally out into a beak, and the
border lines were ornamented with carved figures. As the
current was not very strong, it was found sufficient to have
two boatmen, who squatted down at each extremity of the
canoe; their paddles were about five feet long, and tapered
down towards the end in the shape of a narrow shovel, and to
say the truth, the boatmen used them very much in shovel-fashion.</p>

<p>I had seen the teak canoes on the Red Sea which are
called “Hoory” in Arabic, and are of a build imported from
India, and many of the canoes which are in use at Suakim
and Djidda, but none of these were comparable, either with
respect to size or elegance, with the canoes of the Monbuttoo.
It is remarkable that on the lower course of the Shary there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span>
are no ferry-boats in use except such as are made out of a
number of planks fitted and fastened together; the conclusion
from this would appear to be obvious: either that there are
no fine trees to be felled in that country, similar to those on
the borders of the Welle, or that between the source and
mouth of the Shary there are impediments to navigation
which are insuperable. In the distance of about 1000 miles
to Lake Tsad from the point of our passage, the stream would
have fallen more than 1450 feet.</p>

<p>Our encampment was formed about half-a-league to the
south of the river; it was encircled by the dwellings of the
Monbuttoo, who had spread themselves over the declivity of
a steep woody ravine. The groves in this locality yielded
me every day fresh trophies in my raids upon the vegetable
domains of Nature, whilst at nightfall the natives came
trooping in and enlisted my curious interest. Ambassadors
deputed by King Munza came to bring me his official recognition,
and were charged at the same time to render to him
what information they could about the doings and intentions
of the wonderful stranger. As the messengers sent by the
king were sufficiently versed in the Zandey dialect to hold
conversation in it, I was enabled to make them understand
the object of my visit to their country, and to all appearances
they were thoroughly satisfied by my explanation.</p>

<p>We were still at a little distance from the point which we
had determined must be the limit of our progress for this
year; we had, however, but one day’s rest to make, and then
we should proceed to make our entry into Munza’s quarters. A
fresh world of novelty seemed to be awaiting us in this remote
region, the very kernel of the continent, equally distant from
the Indian Ocean and from the Atlantic. Everything was new.
The bright and clear complexion of the natives, their singular
garb, their artistic furniture, the convenience of their orderly
houses, and finally, the savage etiquette of the pompous court,
all struck me with fresh surprise and ever renewed the feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>
of astonishment. There was, moreover, an exuberance of
strange and unexpected vegetation; whilst plantations, sugar-canes,
and oil-palms were everywhere to be seen in plentiful
luxuriance. Truly, I now found myself in the heart of
Africa, realising to the letter the fascinating dreams of my
early youth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARMS OF THE MONBUTTOO LAND.</div>

<p>Nothing could be more charming than that last day’s
march which brought us to the limit of our wanderings.
The twelve miles which led to Munza’s palace were miles
enriched by such beauty as might be worthy of Paradise.
They left an impression upon my memory which can never
fade. The plantain-groves harmonised so perfectly with the
clustering oil-palms that nothing could surpass the perfection
of the scene; whilst the ferns that adorned the
countless stems in the background of the landscape enhanced
the charms of the tropical groves. A fresh and
invigorating atmosphere contributed to the enjoyment of
it all, refreshing water and grateful shade being never far
away. In front of the native dwellings towered the splendid
figs, of which the spreading crowns defied the passage of
the burning sun. Anon, we passed amidst jungles of
Raphia, alongside brooks crammed full of reeds, or through
galleries where the Pandanus thrived, the road taking us
uphill and downhill in alternate undulation. No less than
twelve of these brooklets did we pass upon our way, some
lying in depressions of one hundred feet, and some sunk as
much as two hundred feet below the summits of their
bounding walls of verdant vegetation, and there were two
upheaved and rounded hills of gneiss, rising to an altitude of
some 300 feet, along the flanks of which we wound our path.
On either hand there was an almost unbroken series of the
idyllic homes of the people, who hurried to their gates, and
offered us the choicest products of their happy clime.</p>

<p>Beside the streamlet which was last but one of all we
passed, we made our final halt in the shadow of a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
assembly-ground that we might take our repast of plantains
and baked manioc. The crowds of bearers made their camp
around the stem of a colossal <i lang="la">Cordia abyssinica</i> which stood
upon the open space in front of the abode of the local chief,
and reminded me of the Abyssinian villages, where this tree
is specially cultivated. Von Beuermann has mentioned that
he observed this tree in Kanem rendering the same service
as the lindens of the German villages, and forming a cool and
shady resort to which the residents might betake themselves
for recreation. These trees, with their goodly coronets of
spreading foliage, are the survivors from generations that
are gone, and form a comely ornament in well-nigh all the
villages of the Monbuttoo.</p>

<p>And then, at last, conspicuous amidst the massy depths of
green, we espied the palace of the king. We had reached a
broad valley, circled by plantations, and shadowed by some
gigantic trees which had survived the decay of the ancient
wilderness; through the lowest part meandered a transparent
brook. We did not descend into the hollow, but halting on
the hither side we chose a station clear of trees, and proceeded
without delay to fix our camp. We enjoyed a view in front
of a sloping area, void of grass, enlivened with an endless
multiplicity of huts, of which the roofs of some were like
ordinary sheds, and those of others of a conical form. And
there, surmounting all, with extensive courts broad and
imposing, unlike anything we had seen since we left the
edifices of Cairo, upreared itself the spacious pile of King
Munza’s dwelling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT KING MUNZA’S PALACE.</div>

<p>The order for the halt was no sooner given than the bearers
set about their wonted work, and labouring with their knives
and hatchets soon procured from the jungles by the brook the
supply of material sufficient for our architectural needs.
Rapidly as ever our encampment was reared: hardly an hour
elapsed before our place of sojourn was in order, with a
gorgeous landscape opening in its front, and this time in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>
view of the royal abode of an African monarch. My own
tent, which began to exhibit only too plainly the tokens of
being somewhat weather-beaten by repeated exposure, was
located in the very midst of the lines of our grass-huts: not
now was it erected, as often it had been, upon the bare rock
of a desolate wilderness, but in the centre of a scene of
surpassing beauty: for the first time I had it decorated
with my flag, which waved proudly above it in honour of
our arrival at the court of so distinguished and powerful a
prince.</p>

<p>The natives lost no time in crowding in and endeavouring
to obtain an interview. But it suited my inclination to withdraw
myself for a time. I remained in the retirement of my
tent simply because I was weary of these interviews, which
always necessitated my permitting either my head to be
handled, in order to convince them that the long straight
hair was really my own, or my bosom (like Wallenstein’s
when he fronted his murderers) to be bared that they
might admire its whiteness. I was thus induced to remain
under shelter, and meanwhile the Monbuttoo magnates waited
patiently or impatiently without; they had brought their
benches, which they placed close to my quarters, but I continued
obstinate in my determination to be undisturbed,
resolved to reserve all my strength and energy for the following
day, when I should have to exhibit the marvel of my
existence before King Munza himself.</p>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged unless indicated below.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the end of the
chapter. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside down,
missing, or partially printed letters and punctuatios, were corrected.
Final stops missing at the end of sentences and abbreviations were
added. Obsolete and alternative spellings were left unchanged.
Misspelled words were not corrected.</p>
